<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>TWO GIRLS OF NORMANDY</h3>
</div>
<p>In all the countryside of Evreux, nay in
all the beauteous old-time Normandy of
the period of 1789, there were no lovelier
<i>filles du peuple</i> than Henriette and Louise
Girard.</p>
<p>Their romantic story was often whispered
by country gossips. In infancy
foundlings on the church steps of Notre
Dame, then brought to this quiet Norman
backwater by the Girards and raised as
sisters, they had lost both their protectors
by death. The same visitation of the dread
plague had cost poor little Louise her eyesight.</p>
<p>Since the orphaning and especially since
the blindness of Louise, Henriette cared
for her with a love overwhelming as that of
a mother for her helpless baby. She looked
forward eagerly to the day when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
might leave the kinswoman&rsquo;s where they
were staying and go to Paris.</p>
<p>A local doctor had imparted a precious
ray of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me, voila! I can do nothing,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Mais, is it not that there are
learned faculties in Paris&ndash;&ndash;men skilled in
chirurgery even to the taking off of cataracts
and the restoration of sight? Of a
truth, yes! En avant, mes enfants! Let
Monsieur Martin, your ancient cousin in
Paris, have the care of you whilst the
chirurgeons exert their skill&ndash;&ndash;presto! if all
goes well, the little one shall yet see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette&rsquo;s heart thumped with joy o&rsquo;er
the cheering prospect. She kissed and
fondled Louise and even teased her. Reading
or chatting to the blind girl, sewing her
frocks or performing a thousand and one
kindly services, her sole thought was to
distract and enliven the prisoned soul behind
the darkened windows.</p>
<p>And so a broad smile crossed the lovely
sightless features and even the dulled orbs
radiated a little as Henriette excitedly told
the details of the proposed trip, and teased:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;And, oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;I forgot&ndash;&ndash;when Miss
Baby&rsquo;s eyes are quite well, I shall sit down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
like a lady&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;ll do all the work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were quite in a fever of delighted
ardor over the preparations for the journey.</p>
<p>Elder sister, attending to everything,
pronounced it perfect with gay little pats
of quaint panniered costumes, fitting of
banded sailor hats o&rsquo;er white coifs, recurling
of ringlets, and dainty polishing of slippers.
The graceful little figures seemed elfin and
fairy-like in the half sleeves and low corsages
of tight bodices from which depended
enormously full skirts set off by cute pinafores.</p>
<p>Round boxes, baskets or bags on either
arm and even the rainy-day umbrella, they
waited in delicious expectancy the serving
man fetching the brass-studded cowhide
trunk, to the very last moment when to
Henriette&rsquo;s surprise the blind girl pouted
and drew back!</p>
<p>She groped until her fingers touched a
chair, then sat down&ndash;&ndash;kerplump!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; announced Louise firmly.
&ldquo;Y-you&rsquo;ll meet somebody or other in Paris&ndash;&ndash;get
married&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be left <i>all
alone</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little general of the expedition paced
hurriedly up and down the floor like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Napoleon at Elba. Shocked surprise at
Louise&rsquo;s awful insinuation struggled with
panic fear. At last Henriette faced her
sister squarely. She came over and knelt
beside her chair, raising a small hand to
high Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Desert you for a Man!&rdquo; said Henriette,
breathlessly. &ldquo;Why, the very idea that I
could ever think such a thing. Dear, here
is my right hand; take it and bear witness:
I solemnly swear <i>never to marry till you
yourself can see and approve my husband</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The left hand of Louise traveled up till
it met and lay flat on the other&rsquo;s upraised
palm. An expression of happiness overspread
the blind girl&rsquo;s face. She leaned
over and kissed her sister. The two girls
rose and left the old home of Evreux.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE JOURNEY TO PARIS</h3>
</div>
<p>Locomotion in those pre-railroad days
was by stage coach except for the rich and
noble who rode in their chaises. The way
of the diligence led past winding streams
and bright meadows busy with haymakers;
past picturesque water mills and stone
chateaux, anon along tree-shaded avenues
grateful in their coolness.</p>
<p>Hard as the leathern seats were and however
wearisome the ride, the girls forgot
discomfort in Henriette&rsquo;s description of the
sights and scenes and Louise&rsquo;s just as eager
listening. Then at the stops the young
women would get out and stretch their
weary limbs whereof they suddenly became
aware as the motion ceased. They were
the only passengers, with unlimited time
for the naive confidences which girlhood
loves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that Cousin Martin will
really meet us at the Paris coach house?&rdquo;
asked the blind sister anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote him that we were coming,&rdquo; replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Henriette simply. &ldquo;Of course he will
be there and awaiting our arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he should not&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, we have his address and will go
to his house. Never fear, little sister, it
will be all right....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lumbering coach-and-six did its hundred
miles a day, bad roads or good roads.
But within a few miles of Paris a whiffletree
broke, the ungainly vehicle stopped,
and the men jumped off to hold the horses
and repair the damage. Henriette and
Louise soon left the hard seats for a few
minutes too.</p>
<p>Down the other side of the narrow turn
of the road where the accident had occurred,
thundered the beautiful carved and
gilded chaise of a famous nobleman, Marquis
de Praille, accompanied by gallant outriders
and backed by liveried footmen on
the high rear seats. Inside the equipage
were the Marquis and his commissionaire
La Fleur.</p>
<p>The black and dusty old stage coach
blocked the way.</p>
<p>As the aristocrat&rsquo;s journey rudely
stopped, with the chaise horses thrown
back on their haunches, a bewigged and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
powdered head was thrust out of the window,
roaring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Descending presently with his follower
to survey the scene, the noble Marquis enraged
at the blocking of his day&rsquo;s pleasuring
belabored the chief ostler with his cane.
Smartly the blows rained down on the
cowering sufferer, alternate right and left
in rhythmic strokes that touched each and
several part of the canaille anatomy.</p>
<p>This gentle exercise finished, the Marquis
espied around the corner of the coach
the two young passengers. Another side
of the Grand Seigneur&rsquo;s nature disclosed
itself.</p>
<p>Mon Dieu, what a vision! Blue eyes,
yellow ringlets framing most kissable features,
dainty form, twinkling feet, flower-like
elegance&ndash;&ndash;a rustic Psyche far more to
be desired than the ladies of the Court!
The Marquis hardly looked twice at the
blind girl. All his glances were for Henriette.</p>
<p>Self-conscious, the noble gentleman
plumed and preened. Patting down his
somewhat ruffled apparel, adjusting his
fashionable wig and peruke, and touching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
up his mouth with the lipstick that the dandies
of that age carried, he advanced elegantly
upon the young women, cane in
one hand and the other toying delicately
with a hand muff.</p>
<p>Henriette curtsied and smiled, and bade
Louise do the same. They knew not the
ways of Courts, but native courtesy and
naive simplicity were theirs. Presently the
elder girl found herself telling the distinguished
personage all the details of their
trip, the appointment with M. Martin, and
the hope of curing Louise by a visit to the
Faculty.</p>
<p>The gallant de Praille, all bows and
smirks, was offering them the hospitality
of the chaise. What a grand stranger,
truly! A regal caress of Henriette&rsquo;s fingers
in the handclasp. Most patronizing (or
was it odious familiarity?) his dainty touch
of her bare arms; the jeweled hand that
toyed with her ringlets; the dexterous move
as if to encircle her waist; the playing&ndash;&ndash;in
the airiest, most fluttering manner imaginable&ndash;&ndash;with
the lace that draped her adorable
little bosom!</p>
<p>Quietly Henriette replied to his overtures:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, monsieur, I think it is best that we
go in our own coach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chastiser of canaille and charmer of
ladies did not seem a whit abashed. Paying
them ceremonious farewell, he withdrew
and repaired to his equipage, the road for
which was now clear. The girls stood a
minute giggling at his mannerisms, as
Henriette described his finery and imitated
his peacock airs.</p>
<p>The girls would not have smiled had they
understood. La Fleur, whom they had
scarcely noticed, was the pander of the
Marquis&rsquo;s vices. The two were deep in
plot. &rsquo;Twas whispered talk, but a chance
bystander might at least have overheard
the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;... At my fete of Bel-Air&ndash;&ndash;make no
mistake, La Fleur&ndash;&ndash;I rely on you. One
hundred louis, the reward....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or another scene that marked de Praille&rsquo;s
entry into Paris, might have interested
them. Driving recklessly to make up time
lost in the blockade, the nobleman&rsquo;s equipage
knocked down and ran over a luckless
denizen of the faubourgs. Carelessly flinging
out gold to the relatives of the dead
woman who were sobbing or cursing him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
he leaned forward and inquired most
solicitously of the driver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But&ndash;&ndash;are the horses hurt?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed the nobles of that time regarded
the masses as little if any superior to cattle
or any other of their possessions.</p>
<p>In the country the common man toiled
a serf without wages, for his master; while
in Paris itself, the centre of gayety and
fashion, the fruit of his toil was expended
by the aristocrats in prodigal luxury.</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie or middle class bore the
brunt of the taxes. A gay parasitic element,
the demi-monde, ministered to
the nobles&rsquo; pleasures. Below, the &ldquo;submerged
tenth&rdquo; of the thievish and begging
classes plied their questionable trades, with
a large margin of the city&rsquo;s population on
the very verge of starvation.</p>
<p>It hints eloquently of the terrible conditions
that there were no less than <i>thirty
thousand professional beggars in Paris at
this time</i>. Their wan, pinched faces, gaunt
forms and palsied vitality were an outstanding
reproach to a flower-like but decadent
aristocratic culture founded on the
muck of cruelty and oppression.</p>
<p>Nothing had the girls (or the simpleminded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
country Doctor who sped them)
known of the dangers or pitfalls of the
city. Vile gallantry or viler underworld
was looking for just such prey....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENED AT THE COACH HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>The Normandy-Paris stage swung into
the city as the shades of evening were falling
and deposited our heroines at journey&rsquo;s
end in a little square beyond the Pont Neuf
where the coach house was situated. As
they alighted, cries of &ldquo;Sedan! Sedan
chair!&rdquo; were heard. Brawling chairmen
&ldquo;mixed it&rdquo; with pummeling fists and kicking
legs to be in the front lines for the
passengers&rsquo; custom.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a terrifying scene from which they
were glad to escape to a side bench whence
they watched the homeward hurrying
throngs and looked vainly for Monsieur
Martin. As in the country, Henriette tried
to pass the time of day with divers and
sundry folk, but it was no use. They gave
her queer looks or hurried on, as if stone
deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They simply pay no attention to you
here!&rdquo; she complained to Louise, &ldquo;but
never mind! Cousin Martin will come
soon, and take us to his home.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>Presently the city lamplighter was lighting
the street lantern above them; he went
his way and the Place was deserted.</p>
<p>There <i>was</i> a man lurking in the shadows
of a portico nearby, though &rsquo;twould somewhat
strain credulity to imagine him the
elderly tradesman Martin. He was a
powerful and burly figure, black habited,
of impudent visage quite unlike a gentle
relative&rsquo;s. In the deeper shadows back of
him crouched two fellows, one of whom
bore in his hand a black cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why does not Monsieur Martin
come?&rdquo; said Henriette to herself softly,
with a little gesture of half-despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your cousin Martin!&rdquo; said the
man, advancing upon them with a smirk
that was like a leer.</p>
<p>Henriette involuntarily drew back, withdrawing
Louise a few steps with her. Relief
and fear of the strange &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; struggled
within her. The man laid a hand on
the elder girl&rsquo;s arm and at the same time
signalled the ruffians. A sudden impulse
moved Henriette to wrench herself free.</p>
<p>In a twinkling the three were upon her.
While the burly leader tore away her grasp
of the blind Louise, the fellow with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
cloth threw it over her face and shoulders,
stifling her screams.</p>
<p>Not a passer-by in sight!</p>
<p>Fiercely Henriette struggled, twice lifting
the cloth from her face, and fiercely
Louise sought to twine herself around the
body of her lovely guide and protector.
But the big man again had thrown the blind
girl off, and the fellows, having tied the
black cloth, lifted Henriette between them
and carried her into a waiting fiacre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got her safe now, La Fleur,&rdquo;
said the kidnappers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive your hardest to Bel-Air, the Marquis&rsquo;s
fete begins at nine o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; said the
villain addressed, who was none other than
the famous nobleman&rsquo;s pander....</p>
<p>What cared the Marquis and La Fleur
about the blind one&rsquo;s misfortunes. As La
Fleur had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear&ndash;&ndash;blindness is ever a good
stock in trade. She&rsquo;ll find her career&ndash;&ndash;in
the streets of Paris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise stopped, and listened for the retreating
footsteps. The noise of the kidnappers&rsquo;
melee was quite stilled. Instead,
the diminishing sound of hoofbeats and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
crunching wheels woke the echoes of the
silent street; mingled with it&ndash;&ndash;perhaps not
even actually, but the memory of an earlier
outcry&ndash;&ndash;the muffled cry, &ldquo;Louise! Louise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise listened again, but no familiar
sound met her ear&ndash;&ndash;only the rushing of the
water, or the footsteps of some pedestrian
in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear nothing,&rdquo; she said, in a terrified
whisper. Hoping against hope, and in a
voice trembling with fear, she spoke as it
were to the empty winds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henriette! Speak to me, speak one
word. Answer me, Henriette!&rdquo; No answer,
no reply!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; sounded faintly on the far-off
wind, or perhaps her poor brain conjured
it. The blind girl knew now that her sister
was beyond reach, and in the power of
cruel men who knew no mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have dragged her away to some
hiding,&rdquo; sensed the poor blind brain, &ldquo;or
perhaps that carriage is bearing her away
from me forever. Oh, what shall I do?&rdquo;
she cried aloud, in tones that would have
thrilled a hearer&rsquo;s heart with pity. &ldquo;Alone&ndash;&ndash;alone!
Abandoned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the last word the full horror of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
her situation surged upon her, and she
burst into a torrent of tears. Alone in
Paris! Blind and alone, without relatives
or friends.</p>
<p>You who sit in a cozy home, surrounded
by safeguards and comforts, can have no
idea of the blind foundling&rsquo;s utter dependence
or the terrible meaning conveyed by
the one word &ldquo;abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will become of me?&rdquo; she cried,
between the sobs. &ldquo;Alone in this great
city; helpless and blind&ndash;&ndash;my God, what
<i>shall</i> I do? Where am I to go? I do not
know which way to turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Self-preservation, and the piteous hope
that the house fronts might give her some
clue to her bearings, caused the girl to
stagger from the centre of the square to
the sides. Along one of them she picked
her way, moaning for help and having not
even a stick to guide her. Slowly, painfully
she groped around the Place until unwittingly
she approached the railing or wall
which served as a guard to the steep bank
that descended to the river.</p>
<p>Along this she felt her way until suddenly
her hands met the empty air. What,
now? Should she return as she had come?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
No, she thought; the flagging beneath her
feet was heavy and substantial: &rsquo;twas probably
the intersection of another street, and
a few steps would bring her to house fronts
again.</p>
<p>Louise walked down the flags and
stepped into nothingness&ndash;&ndash;thirty feet sheer
precipice into the river Seine!</p>
<p>In the instant horror of falling to death
off the stone pier, she found herself saved
by being clasped in a man&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; this individual exclaimed
as he bore her to the centre of the
square. &ldquo;What were you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing&ndash;&ndash;what was it?&rdquo;
cried Louise incoherently, realizing only
that she had been pulled back from death&rsquo;s
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another moment,&rdquo; said the man in horror-stricken
accents, &ldquo;and you would have
been drowned in the Seine! I leaped up
the steps and just managed to catch you.
Lucky that five minutes ago I had to go
down to the river to fill my water can.
You&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tones of the voice, which struck
Louise as young-old in its timbre, were
soft and kind with a refined and even plaintive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
quality albeit not cultured. Here was
a good soul and a friend, she sensed at once.
But could she suddenly have won her sight,
Louise would have been astonished at the
actual vision.</p>
<p>Pale narrow spirituelle features, lit by
beautiful eyes and surmounted by a wealth
of straight black hair; a form haggard,
weazened by deformity, yet evidencing
muscular toil; delicate hands and feet that
like the features bespoke the poesy of soul
within mis-shapen shell,&ndash;&ndash;the hunchback
scissors-grinder Pierre Frochard presented
a remarkable aspect which, once seen, no
one could ever forget!</p>
<p>Wonder and awe were writ on the pale
face as he looked at the lovely angel he had
rescued. Pierre shuddered again over the
escape. Better that he should have suffered
myriad deaths than that a hair of
that lovely head were injured. As for himself&ndash;&ndash;poor
object of the world&rsquo;s scorn and
his family&rsquo;s revilings&ndash;&ndash;was he worthy e&rsquo;en
to kiss the hem of her garment?</p>
<p>Pierre looked yet again. The angelic
little creature was blind! Wide-open yet
sightless orbs whereof the cataracts blackened
the view of all Life&rsquo;s perils, as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
had of the imminent river. A surge of self-abnegating,
celestial love, mingled with
divine pity, filled the hunchback&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>Tenderly he inquired about her misfortune,
and she told him the sad tale of the
journey and Henriette&rsquo;s kidnapping.... Their
talk was broken in upon by the entry
of the hag Mere Frochard and her elder
son.</p>
<p>Alas, poor Louise! In finding a friend
thou hast likewise found the bitter bread
of the stranger and the slavery of the Frochard
clan! The wretched hunchback is
himself in thrall. Little dreams he the woe
that shall attend ye both, the while Henriette
is the victim of far mightier pomps
and powers.</p>
<p>Though Henriette shall not know thy
fate for many a day, though she shall search
long and frantically and not meet the beloved
until within the shadow of the guillotine,
it may give the reader what comfort
it will that the blind sister still lives&ndash;&ndash;a lost
mite in the vast ocean of Paris!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE FETE OF BEL-AIR</h3>
</div>
<p>Henrietta had swooned in the vehicle
which was being rapidly driven into open
country.</p>
<p>Gradually color came back into wan
cheeks. The blue orbs and Cupid lips fluttered
and half opened; the dazed little brain
tried vainly to sense what had happened.</p>
<p>Quickly the man La Fleur took out a
small phial and poured some few drops of
a dark liquid on the girl&rsquo;s tongue. Half
consciously swallowing it, she sank back
again&ndash;&ndash;this time, into a deeper nirvana.</p>
<p>They were coming now to a large estate,
the grounds of which were brightly illuminated.
Outside the iron palings a crowd
of beggars shrieked and gesticulated. Within,
all was gayety. La Fleur and his fellows
dismounted with their burden. They laid
the inanimate form of the Norman girl on
a litter and covered it with a white canopy.
As this strange pallet awaits the Master&rsquo;s
wishes in anteroom, let us take a peep at
the celebrated Sunken Gardens.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>Bel-Air had been beautified in the lovely
exedra style for which Petit Trianon is
noted. Art blended so cunningly with Nature
one might almost mistake marble
Venus for live goddess or flesh-and-blood
naiads of the lake for carved caryatides.
The very musicians seemed children of Pan
as they tuned their lyres and fiddles in
woodland nook.</p>
<p>Before the splashing fountain supported
by little naked Loves in marble&ndash;&ndash;flanked by
balustrades and bordered by screens of
myriad crystalline glass drops&ndash;&ndash;a cool
white pavement invited the gay minuet.
Beyond, a huge banquet table groaned with
delicacies and wines the cost of which
would have gone far to rationing the thirty
thousand hungry of the nearby City. Indeed,
enough was wasted to have fed many.
With bizarre and often gross entertainment
Marquis de Praille amused his guests who
themselves presented a wanton and amorous
scene that seemed itself a part of the
elaborately staged revels.</p>
<p>What gallantry, what passion, what low
asides and snatched kisses! as the squirming
dancers intoxicated the spectators&rsquo;
sense or gauzily draped coryphees plunged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in the pool now converted into a fountain
of wine. The elegant gentlemen and the
audacious women guests&ndash;&ndash;themselves miracles
of bold costuming and sixty-inch
snow-white coiffures&ndash;&ndash;knew the play foretold
the coarser revels that all would indulge
in after midnight.</p>
<p>Around the banqueting tables a number
of ladies and gentlemen were seated, some
still toying with the savory viands and
drinking rare vintages of Champagne,
whilst others idly watched the dancers or
discussed the latest court news and high life
scandal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of my retreat
from the whirl and bustle of Paris?&rdquo; asked
Marquis de Praille of his vis-a-vis, who was
a dashing sort of beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Marquis,&rdquo; replied that lady,
&ldquo;I am delighted. It is a satisfaction to find
a gentleman who maintains the customs of
his rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet there are fools who want to
change them,&rdquo; exclaimed a young nobleman
from the opposite table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right&ndash;&ndash;fools&ndash;&ndash;fools,&rdquo; answered
de Praille, as he motioned to the servants
for more wine.</p>

I WON&rsquo;T GO ANNOUNCED LOUISE FIRMLY. YOU&rsquo;LL MEET<br />
SOMEBODY, GET MARRIED AND I&rsquo;LL BE LEFT ALL ALONE.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked the lady who had
first spoken, &ldquo;you have heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As no one had heard anything particularly
new for the last two hours, she continued
by saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that the new minister of police
is as hard as a stone, and cold as a fish. He
is going to put a stop to all our amusements,
and, Marquis, this may be the last
entertainment you will give at Bel-Air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the host. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to see the minister of police who would
dare to interfere with the pleasures of a
French nobleman. Who and what is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is from Touraine; is called the Count
de Linieres, and is the uncle of the Chevalier
Maurice de Vaudrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Chevalier?&rdquo; suddenly
asked one of the ladies, as she was thus
reminded of one whom report had described
as rather eccentric, and on whom
she wished to exercise her charms. &ldquo;You
promised me I should see him, Marquis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, and I expect him, as well as
another guest. I warn you, ladies, that she
will be the rival to you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the other guest?&rdquo; was the question
which assailed him from all quarters.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A young lady,&rdquo; answered the Marquis
as if enraptured at the thought. &ldquo;Sweet
sixteen, beautiful as a rose, and innocent as
an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find such a pearl?&rdquo;
asked one of the ladies banteringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement was followed by a
titter from the feminine members of the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know these Normandy beauties!&rdquo;
scorned one of the ladies, betraying
in spite of herself a tinge of jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rustics! Quite unpolished and de
trop,&rdquo; chimed in another fair one, cat-like
in her verbal claws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh away, ladies,&rdquo; said de Praille
gayly. &ldquo;You shall see a real Norman
beauty, and then see how jealous you will
all become at sight of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a noise was heard from
the outside, and in the midst of some confusion
a rather singular voice was heard
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I must go in, and I will. I
must speak to your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this the Marquis went toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the entrance, and demanded of the servants
who this was who was so importunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picard,&rdquo; answered the owner of the singular
voice. &ldquo;Picard, valet to the Chevalier
de Vaudrey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis immediately gave orders
that he be admitted, and a sharp, wiry-looking
fellow, wearing the de Vaudrey livery,
stood before the gay party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most excellent Marquis and most beautiful
ladies,&rdquo; he said to the general mirth
as he curtsied low and executed a neat pas
seul, &ldquo;my master the Chevalier is very late,
but he will surely appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late?&rdquo; protested one of the young
blades who knew the Prefect&rsquo;s nephew.
&ldquo;Why, he told me he expected to be here
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, detained by business&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; replied
Picard in a melancholy tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business! A young nobleman has no
business!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so, gentlemen. Some nights, I
grant you, he devotes to pleasure, as a
young aristocrat should; but his days&ndash;&ndash;how
do you suppose he spends his days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleeps, of course,&rdquo; said the Marquis, in
a positive tone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, allow me to tell you confidentially,&rdquo;
said the valet mysteriously as
the gentlemen gathered around him, fully
expecting to hear of some treason. &ldquo;He
works! actually works! He sits down and
reads and writes as though he were an
advocate.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>BEL-AIR&ndash;&ndash;(CONTINUED)</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; exclaimed one. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect
us to believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and more, too,&rdquo; answered Picard,
who enjoyed immensely being able to impart
some information to his superiors.
&ldquo;Why, how do you suppose he acts to the
common people who want to see him? His
creditors, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if they are importunate, he beats
them, I suppose,&rdquo; answered de Praille, who
often &ldquo;settled&rdquo; bills thus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he beats them,&rdquo; sneered Picard;
&ldquo;he pays them! Yes, gentlemen, he pays
his tradespeople.&rdquo; And the valet surveyed
the group, enjoying the surprise he had
given them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the poor fellow is lost!&rdquo; exclaimed
one of the party, who at the age of twenty
had spent a large fortune and was now
living on his wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Completely,&rdquo; affirmed Picard, &ldquo;and all
owing to the company he keeps. He won&rsquo;t
be guided by me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chevalier Maurice de Vaudrey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picard&rsquo;s further revelations were cut
short by the entry of his master who dismissed
the valet and presented his apologies
to the company.</p>
<p>In any assemblage the young Chevalier
of twenty-two might have been remarked
for his Greek God features and the occasional
smile that made him look, from time
to time, a veritable bright Phoebus Apollo.</p>
<p>He was far handsomer, far more attractive
than the host, but a young-old cynic
about these goings-on. Nephew of the
police prefect of Paris, he had been specially
invited to forestall&ndash;&ndash;by reason of his
presence&ndash;&ndash;any Governmental swooping
down on Praille&rsquo;s wild party. Evidently he
was not thinking of morals or of license,
but his thoughts were far other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people cry out for bread,&rdquo; said the
Chevalier, looking at the board and thinking
of the shrieking beggars.</p>
<p>Marquis de Praille raised his fashionable
lorgnette, contemplating a vast chateau-like
confection on the table, and sprung his
little joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they eat cake?&rdquo; he replied
airily, with a cackling laugh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>De Vaudrey smiled fleetingly, then half-serious,
half-smiling, raised a hand in polite
protest. Two fair ones carried him off
eagerly to retail to the distinguished visitor
a morsel of gossip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Marquis has made another conquest!&rdquo;
whispered one to him behind her
fan, to which the other added: &ldquo;Yes, he
found a <i>marvelously beautiful</i> Norman
peasant journeying to Paris in a stage
coach, so he had La Fleur take her and fetch
her here&ndash;&ndash;a mere rustic, to outvie us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;twill be good sport,&rdquo; replied the
cynic. &ldquo;These country girls that his excellency
abducts are willing victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a procession of
servants bringing in the covered pallet.</p>
<p>The spread was thrown off, a restorative
administered to the recumbent figure&ndash;&ndash;Henriette
sat up and gazed in blank stupefaction
at the crowding revelers.</p>
<p>She staggered to her feet, looking for a
friendly face somewhere.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, the mental image of her
lost sister shot her as with a violent agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister Louise&ndash;&ndash;where is she?&rdquo; she
pleaded. &ldquo;Quick! Please let me go to her&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t
you understand? She is BLIND!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
Sobs almost choked the little voice. &ldquo;She
cannot take a SINGLE STEP without
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Vaudrey looked up to see the tiny
creature running hither and yon, asking the
laughing gentlemen for help, repulsing
Praille&rsquo;s embraces, fending off the other
satyr who would drown her sorrows in fizz.
If this were play-acting, it excelled the finest
efforts of Adrienne Lecouvreur! De
Praille had now grasped her firmly by the
waist and shoulders, his sensual breath was
on her cheek, a last cry escaped her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among all these noblemen, is there not
ONE MAN OF HONOR?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The despairing outcry pierced the Chevalier&rsquo;s
shallow cynicism, touching the finer
feelings that had lain dormant.</p>
<p>He sprang to her side, dashed de Praille&rsquo;s
arms from her exquisite form. Then, facing
his bewildered host, he said in calm
even tones to the girl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mademoiselle, we will leave this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting the word to the action, he offered
his arm to Henriette and started to go.
With a fury restrained only by conventional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
usages, de Praille was across their path
and barred the way with his wand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my house,&rdquo; he said hoarsely,
&ldquo;and I will not permit this insult!&rdquo; As he
spoke, the chimes sounded midnight. &ldquo;Do
you hear? After twelve o&rsquo;clock, no one
ever leaves Bel-Air!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer de Vaudrey dashed aside the
extended wand, escorted the kidnapped girl
to the foot of the staircase. De Praille was
upon them again. This time he drew his
sword. Fascinated, the courtiers and their
women companions watched the outcome.</p>
<p>Gently shielding Henriette behind him,
de Vaudrey drew. Stroke and counterstroke
and parry of rapiers and lightning-like
motion glinted in the air. Henriette
was the affrighted center of the fashionable
group that, according to the custom of that
time, awaited the issue of the duel without
intervening.</p>
<p>Glory be! her protector was parrying the
Marquis&rsquo; wild thrusts while he himself
bided an opening. It came with a suddenness
as dramatic as the duel itself. A lunge
of the villain had left his own side exposed.
De Vaudrey sidestepped and as he did so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
plunged his rapier between the ribs of the
owner of Bel-Air.</p>
<p>The mortally stricken de Praille sank
back against a marble bench. De Vaudrey
scarcely glanced at him. Taking Henriette
by the hand, he rushed with her up the
staircase and out to liberty.</p>
<p>Before the Grand Seigneur&rsquo;s cronies
thought to avenge their master, they had
passed the astonished servants, passed the
minatory beggars at the gates, and hailing
a fiacre were on their way to Paris.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>IN THE FROCHARDS&rsquo; DEN</h3>
</div>
<p>One hundred and fifty years of outlawry
had made the Frochard clan a wolfish
breed; battening on crime, thievery and
beggary. The head of the house had suffered
the extreme penalty meted out to
highwaymen. The precious young hopeful,
Jacques, was a chip of the old block&ndash;&ndash;possibly
a shade more drunken and a shade
less enterprising.</p>
<p>But the real masterful figure was the
Widow Frochard, his mother, a hag whose
street appearance nurses used to frighten
naughty children. Hard masculine features,
disheveled locks and piercing black
eyes gave her a fearsome look enhanced by
a very vigorous moustache, a huge wart
near the mouth, the ear-hoops and tobacco
pipe that she sported, and the miscellaneous
mass of rags that constituted her costume.</p>
<p>In this menage of the begging Frochards,
the crippled scissors-grinder Pierre was the
only individual worth his salt, and he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
heartily despised by his brother Jacques
and his mother.</p>
<p>The hag&rsquo;s black eyes snapped as she saw
Louise whom the hunchback had saved
from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty&ndash;&ndash;blind&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll beg us lots of
money!&rdquo; she said gleefully to Jacques. But
to the girl she pretended aid, and her leathern,
liquor-coated voice proclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No friends, eh, Dearie? Then I&rsquo;ll take
care of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only poor Pierre sympathized with
Louise&rsquo;s awful grief in being thrown adrift
on Paris through the violent disappearance
of her beloved sister. He trembled to think
what knavery his wicked kinsfolk meant,
though he himself was their helpless slave;
the target of kicks, cuffs, and the robbery
of all his earnings.</p>
<p>La Frochard led the way to their dank
and noisome den, opening from a street
trap-door and giving at the other extremity
on a sort of water-rat exit underneath the
pier. She handed Louise down the steps
and taking her things remarked in a self-satisfied
tone: &ldquo;Here are your lodgings,
Dearie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman arrayed herself in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
Louise&rsquo;s shawl, and grinned as she tried on
the girl&rsquo;s widespread garden hat. She flung
the girl about roughly, even choking her.
To heighten the rosy picture of great
wealth to accrue, she took a deep draught
of cognac from her loved black bottle. Poor
Louise sank down to deep slumber, from
which neither the noisy potations of La
Frochard and Jacques, nor their cursing
and abuse of the hunchback Pierre, sufficed
to awaken her.</p>
<p>Next morning the hag pulled the blind
girl out of the rough bed and dressed her
in beggar&rsquo;s garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go out now on the street with
us and sing!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... But you promised to help me find
Henriette....&rdquo; said the poor girl, piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find her for you one of these days,
but in the meantime you must earn your
keep. No&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t mean, actually beg!
You do the singing, and I&rsquo;ll do the begging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Louise. &ldquo;You may kill
me if you will, but I&rsquo;ll not be a street beggar.
Why, the very first person we meet,
I&rsquo;ll ask to save me and inform the police!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you, my fine lady!&rdquo; screamed
La Frochard, throwing her from her.
&ldquo;Come, Jacques,&rdquo; she said to her ruffian
son, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll trying a means of making her
mind!&rdquo; Together they seized and started
dragging her to the steps of a sub-cellar.
Tremblingly Pierre urged them to desist,
but they cast him aside.</p>
<p>Louise was thrust into the dungeon and
the trap closed. Black bread and a cup of
water was to be her prison fare. Still
moaning &ldquo;Henriette! Henriette!&rdquo; she
groped along the slimy walls and tried the footing
of the mingled mud and straw.</p>
<p>Horrors! What were the creeping
things she sensed, though sightless? Two
raced under her petticoat, one nibbled at
her shoe. She jumped high in air and
screamed outright.</p>
<p>Rats! They were upon her again, almost
swarming. She fled to a corner, leaped on
a pile of rags, literally fought them off with
both hands! Her screams echoed through
the upper den, to the anguish of Pierre and
the mocking laughter of La Frochard and
Jacques....</p>
<p>Pitiably broken, Louise was pulled out
of the vile sink a few hours later, pledging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
wildly to obey the least of the hag&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p>La Frochard knew that her conquest was
complete.</p>
<p>Henceforth the girl would be but as a
clay figure in her hands&ndash;&ndash;a decoy to lure
the golden charity of the rich and sympathetic.</p>
<p>As for Jacques, that ruffian was now
eyeing the blind lass closely, and muttering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad-looking&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll see to it no other
man gets her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slapped his knife villainously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>TANGLED SKEINS</h3>
</div>
<p>Henriette Girard had not only been saved
from dishonor by Chevalier de Vaudrey,
but she had won a devoted friend. Through
his connections, the Chevalier knew much
that was passing in the half-world. The
mystery of the happenings at the coach
house was cleared by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your cousin M. Martin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was
found drugged in a wineshop to which presumably
the man La Fleur had enticed him.
It was easy then for La Fleur to pose as
Martin and kidnap you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grieve to say it, abductions of the poor
and friendless are common with the roues
of fashion. Their families are of such influence
that the police rarely interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there will be an end of this&ndash;&ndash;if I
mistake not,&rdquo; said the Chevalier, &ldquo;the people
mean to put an end to these seignorial
&lsquo;privileges&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

THE MARQUIS DE PRAILLE IS ENRAPTURED BY THE LITTLE VISION<br />
FROM THE STAGE COACH (HENRIETTE PLAYED BY LILLIAN GISH.)<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>It was in one of his frequent talks at the
simple lodgings to which he had conducted
her the night of Bel-Air. Swiftly they had
retraced the steps of the stricken Louise
even to the pier edge over the darkling
Seine. Horrified and trembling, Henriette
feared the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not likely she was drowned,&rdquo; said
the Chevalier gravely. &ldquo;Someone must
have been about, to save her. Do not be
discouraged, Mademoiselle, if our search
for Louise takes several days. We are
without a clew&ndash;&ndash;groping, like her, in the
dark. But we shall find her, never fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confident words gave tiny comfort
to the elder girl as he bade his adieux in
the parlor of the respectable lodging house
he had found for her&ndash;&ndash;the same caravansary
(had they but known it) that housed
the then obscure Maximilien Robespierre.</p>
<p>She strove to thank him for his kindness
when he interrupted her: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank
<i>me</i>, Mademoiselle, I owe <i>you</i> a debt of
gratitude, for you have restored to me
ideals sweet as childhood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconsciously the young people standing
there, drew closer to one another until
their lips met. Each was almost too astonished
for words. Fine breeding came to
de Vaudrey&rsquo;s aid. He apologized&ndash;&ndash;and
promised not to let it happen again!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>Sincerity spoke in the young man&rsquo;s earnest
eyes and his respectful kiss of her small
hand at parting.</p>
<p>Was indeed this youthful cynic transformed
by the flower-like influence of the
girl?</p>
<p>He went away all eagerness to pursue the
lost sister&rsquo;s quest, promising that no stone&ndash;&ndash;police
or other&ndash;&ndash;should be left unturned
in the search.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And here&ndash;&ndash;where the orphans&rsquo; eventful
epoch becomes entwined with the lives of
the great and with the darkening storm and
impending passion of the Revolution&ndash;&ndash;it is
well to acquaint our readers further with
the de Vaudreys.</p>
<p>Count de Linieres of Touraine had been
married&ndash;&ndash;many years before the date of
this story&ndash;&ndash;to Mlle. de Vaudrey, the heiress
of a great fortune. A skeleton (&rsquo;twas
rumored) rattled in the Vaudrey closet.
Certainly there was heritage of hates as
well as gold.</p>
<p>A tenant Jean Setain, who came to the
Paris mansion to pay his rent, made a
scene. He told of the cruelties long ago
inflicted on his father by the Countess&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
father&ndash;&ndash;for some trifling trespass on seigniorage,
<i>boiling lead in the unfortunate&rsquo;s
veins</i>&ndash;&ndash;and the angry Count, after a stern
rebuke, had him ejected. Jacques-Forget-Not
(such was his queer nickname) departed,
vowing vengeance.</p>
<p>Having ample wealth, the Count desired
preferment. The post of Minister of Police
was a steppingstone. He accepted it whilst
visions of a grand alliance for his nephew,
Chevalier de Vaudrey, pointed to dukedom
or even princely rank as the family&rsquo;s goal.
It thus vexed Linieres exceedingly that the
Chevalier should have been mixed up in a
duel about an unknown girl. He believed
it a clever stroke to hire Picard, the Chevalier&rsquo;s
own valet, to spy upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your master&rsquo;s conduct?&rdquo; asked
the Count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scandalous, perfectly scandalous!&rdquo; replied
Picard in a tone of deep dejection.
&ldquo;Once indeed he had a few gentleman associates
and went to gay parties, but now he
is quite moral, and just as studious as a
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk. Really I must leave the
Chevalier,&rdquo; continued Picard, &ldquo;his principles
are such as I cannot accept!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will re-engage you&ndash;&ndash;on one condition.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
That is, that you remain a while
with my nephew and tell me everything he
does. I have heard, on the contrary,
that&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picard almost danced a pas seul. &ldquo;Oh,
that is the way the wind lies! The sly
dog!&ndash;&ndash;And I thought of leaving him. She
must be a saucy and jaunty little minx,
whoever she is! Oh, yes, I will find out
everything that you require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With eye to keyhole the valet reporter
saw the frequent innocent parleys of Maurice
and Henriette, which he construed as
an intrigue. He was quite ecstatic with
happiness now. The police Prefect, finding
his suspicions privately confirmed, bluntly
refused police aid to the Chevalier&rsquo;s hunt
for Louise. He spoke pointedly and (as he
hoped) with effect:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, you must give up your association
with these common people. I have
other plans for you that will shortly mature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry Count could not be crossed.
De Vaudrey&rsquo;s sole hope lay in his Aunt.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Ceaselessly Henriette spent her days in
trying to trace Louise. Her quest became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
the neighborhood gossip. Strangers interested
themselves and offered clues to herself
and the Chevalier&ndash;&ndash;clues that proved
quite futile.</p>
<p>To her doorstep a great pock-marked
man, bushy-browed and of knob-like visage,
was walking one day with her finicky
dandified neighbor M. Robespierre. As he
passed, the titan turned and inquired
kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the little girl who lost her
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with a gentle sympathy that
touched her and even his cursing reference
to the abductions: &ldquo;Damned aristocrats!
The people are going to stop that sort of
thing!&rdquo; did not phase her, for she looked
up into his face and trustfully replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such a big man I should think
you could do almost anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robespierre was pawing at the pock-marked
one&rsquo;s coat, and finally succeeded in
yanking him around. The broad back of
the giant being turned to her, our little
sparrow of a Henriette noiselessly departed&ndash;&ndash;to
the evident disappointment of the big
man who looked yet again and found her
place empty!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>The big man had run across Chevalier
de Vaudrey also, and the two had struck up
a friendship. Moved by the pitiful sight of
a starveling crowd gazing into a bakery,
Maurice had rushed in and bought an armful
of loaves which he distributed, adding
gold louis for the wretched mothers of
families. The pock-marked one had been
a spectator. He stopped the Chevalier,
shook his hand warmly, and remarked: &ldquo;If
more of the aristocrats were like <i>you</i>,
things would be different!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>From these scenes of low life, let the
reader pass for a few moments to the Salon
de la Paix at Versailles, where King Louis
XVI received petitioners.</p>
<p>We in America who have no awe of
royalty perceive that the luckless King was
simply a square peg in a round hole. He
loved locksmithy, hunting, and home;
would have been a successful inventor,
pioneer, or bourgeois parent. In the chair
of State, on this day of petitions, his head
and hand busied themselves with a wonderful
new doorlock he had devised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the suppliant de Linieres, &ldquo;in
the matter of the grand alliance betwixt my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
nephew Chevalier de Vaudrey and your
ward Princesse de Acquitaine&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monarch nodded absentmindedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes! Of course. As you say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
With a courtly wave of the hand, the monarch
indicated the waiting heiress on his
right. She curtsied low in acceptance of
the royal command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the young man marry her, and
accept a place in my royal entourage&ndash;&ndash;But
now that this little matter is settled,&rdquo;
continued the King with a return to his former
animation, &ldquo;I invite you to examine
my latest invention, an unpickable lock,
which I have here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave comedy of eulogy on the royal
locksmithing was played by the delighted
suppliant according to all the rules.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE HONOR OF THE FAMILY</h3>
</div>
<p>Daily the young Chevalier developed a
warmer interest in the sweet and pure
young girl at the faubourg lodgings. Always
his visits brought a little delicious
heart-flutter to Henriette, though not unmixed
with mourning o&rsquo;er lost sister. And
as a result of these idyllic meetings, ambitious
plans appeared to him abhorrent.</p>
<p>About this time the Countess de Linieres,
calling one day at her husband&rsquo;s
ministerial offices, learned of his purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was about to come to you,&rdquo; said the
Count, &ldquo;but you have anticipated me. I
desire to speak with you on the subject of
your nephew, the Chevalier de Vaudrey,
and to ask you to prepare him for the marriage
which the King&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wishes to impose on him,&rdquo; interrupted
the Countess bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impose on him?&rdquo; repeated de Linieres.
&ldquo;It is a magnificent alliance, which will
complete the measure of the distinguished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
honors with which His Majesty deigns to
favor us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you spoken to the Chevalier yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I am expecting him every moment,
and I wished to talk with him in your
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if this conversation had some influence
over him, de Vaudrey entered at this
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Chevalier!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count.
&ldquo;I am glad to see you. The Countess and
myself have an important communication
to make to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Vaudrey looked at his uncle in surprise.
The latter was positively beaming.
Big with the prospective grandeur of his
house, he hesitated momentarily over the
manner of delivering it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Maurice,&rdquo; said the Count finally,
&ldquo;the King did me the honor to receive
me yesterday, and he spoke of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of me?&rdquo; asked de Vaudrey in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He takes a great interest in you,&rdquo; continued
de Linieres, now speaking quickly.
&ldquo;He wishes you to accept a position at
court, and desires at the same time that you
should marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry?&rdquo; asked de Vaudrey, as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
he could not believe his uncle really meant
what he said.</p>
<p>The Countess waited as anxiously for de
Vaudrey&rsquo;s answer as did her husband,
though for a different reason. She loved
the young man before her, and his happiness
and well-being were very dear to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew,&rdquo; she said kindly, &ldquo;I
see that this news surprises you. Yet there
is no fear that the King&rsquo;s choice will do
violence to your feelings. The lady whom
His Majesty has chosen, has youth, beauty
and fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In proof of which I have only to tell you
that his choice is Princesse&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the Count
attempted to say, but was interrupted by
the Chevalier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not name her,&rdquo; he said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked his uncle in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I refuse to marry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of these momentous words
was quite diverse upon the uncle and the
aunt of the young man.</p>
<p>For the moment the haughty nobleman
could not understand why his nephew-by-marriage
should reject the flattering proposal,
such an easy and agreeable road to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
place and fortune. Soon rising anger got
the better of his surprise, and minding
Picard&rsquo;s reports on the Chevalier&rsquo;s conduct,
his thought was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the secret&ndash;&ndash;he prefers his libertine
courses to assured fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Aunt, with a woman&rsquo;s ready wit,
understood there could be but one reason
to such a decided refusal, and knew that he
must be already in love.</p>
<p>Countess de Linieres loved the Chevalier
as if he were her own son. Quickly she shot
the youth a warning look to prevent if possible
a verbal passage of arms. But it was
already too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare to disobey the King&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; thundered
Count de Linieres, in righteous
wrath, backed (as the others well knew) by
the triple authority of household, police and
royal cachet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sword is my King&rsquo;s,&rdquo; flashed the
handsome youth resolutely, &ldquo;but my will
must remain my own!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to His Majesty,&rdquo; he continued
passionately. &ldquo;I will thank him for his
goodness, place my services at his disposal.
My devotion, my life are his, but my affections
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
are my own, and I wish to remain&ndash;&ndash;free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count scornfully.
&ldquo;Free to lead a life of dissipation which you
may not always be able to hide from the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, which implied so much,
stung the noble-hearted de Vaudrey more
than any words of anger or reproach could
have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in my life to hide,&rdquo; he
said proudly but impatiently, &ldquo;nothing for
which I have reason to blush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that, Chevalier?&rdquo; asked
the Count, in a tone that plainly said the
speaker knew differently. Conscious of his
own uprightness, this doubt cast upon his
word was more than the Chevalier could
bear, and he advanced toward his uncle with
a menacing air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; he began, boldly, &ldquo;I cannot&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice! my husband!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Countess, as she stepped between the two
men to prevent those words being spoken
which would have led to an encounter.
&ldquo;Defer the conversation for the present.
Permit me to speak to Maurice.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said de Linieres sternly.
Then turning to the Chevalier he said, in a
voice which he had never before used to his
nephew: &ldquo;We will return to this another
time. You will remember that as head of
the family its honor is confided to my care,
and I will not suffer any one to sully it with
a stain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Vaudrey had nearly lost all control of
his temper. In a moment the outbreak
which the Countess was so anxious to avoid
would have broken forth, had not the Count
without giving his nephew time to speak
said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave you with the Countess. I hope
that your respect and affection for her will
cause you to lend more weight to her counsels
than you are disposed to give to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if fearing that he might have tried the
young man&rsquo;s temper too far, or that he did
not wish to prolong a useless scene, the
Count left the room. De Vaudrey was
alone with his Aunt.</p>
<p>The Countess went up to the noble-looking
young man, and taking his hand in hers,
asked in a sweet, winning voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this woman you love? What
obstacle prevents the avowal of your passion?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
If it is only a matter of fortune, take
mine; it is all at your disposal, and I will
give it to you cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, where shall I find a heart like
yours?&rdquo; exclaimed the Chevalier in a voice
trembling with emotion. &ldquo;You have divined
my secret. I adore a young girl as
charming as she is pure. Yet never have I
dared to whisper my passion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name&ndash;&ndash;her family?&rdquo; asked the
Countess eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was born of the people,&rdquo; said de
Vaudrey proudly, yet tenderly. &ldquo;She is an
orphan and lives by the labor of her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess, who had never for a moment
imagined such an answer to her question,
was surprised, and she showed plainly
that grief was mingled with her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would make such a woman
your wife?&rdquo; she asked reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not judge her until you have seen
her,&rdquo; entreated the Chevalier. &ldquo;Consent to
see her, and then advise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man took the Countess&rsquo;s
hands in his, and looked imploringly into
her face.</p>
<p>But his Aunt turned away from him with
a gesture of sorrow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In such a marriage,&rdquo; she said sadly,
&ldquo;there can be no happiness for you, and for
her, only misery. Alas! I know too well the
result of those unequal unions. You must
renounce her. You owe obedience to your
family and your King.&rdquo; She burst into a
flood of tears.</p>
<p>Diffidently the young man sought to comfort
the Countess whose emotion seemed to
have its spring in some hidden sorrow. He
promised at last for her sake to consider
again the horribly odious proposal of a
State marriage, and drying her tears as well
as he could, went his way, a victim of torn
desires and intensest anguish....</p>

<h3>FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE</h3>
</div>
<p>The giant stranger who had talked to
Henriette and made friends with de Vaudrey
was Jacques Danton. He and his colleague,
Maximilien Robespierre, were destined
to be the outstanding figures of the
French Revolution. It is worth while to
stop here for a little and consider these two
men in their historical aspects and for the
profound influence which they exerted on
the lives of our characters.</p>
<p>As the storm clouds blacken the sky and
the sullen sea (not yet lashed to fury) is
ridged in deep, advancing breakers, the
mariner&rsquo;s eye discerns these stormy petrels
flying about or momentarily perched on the
masts of the Ship of State.</p>
<p>Mark them well&ndash;&ndash;Danton and Robespierre:
today, merely &ldquo;esurient advocates,&rdquo;
petty men of law come up from the provinces
to win their fortunes in Paris; tomorrow,
leaders of faction; some months
or years later, the rulers of France!</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>Danton&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the huge, brawny figure,
through whose black brows and rude flattened
face there looks a waste energy as of
Hercules not yet furibund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robespierre&ndash;&ndash;aptly described as the
meanest man of the Tiers Estat: &ldquo;that
anxious, slight, ineffectual-looking man,
under thirty, in spectacles; his eyes, troubled,
careful; with upturned face, snuffing
dimly the uncertain future-time; complexion
of a multiplex atrabiliar color, the final
shade of which may be the pale sea-green!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were they, afterwards to be known
respectively as &ldquo;the pock-marked Thunderer&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;sea-green Incorruptible&rdquo;
of the Revolution. The slight, fox-like man
had got himself elected to the States-General
which in May, 1789, convened at Versailles
to take up the troubled state of the
country, whilst the lion-like and fiery Danton
was the president of the Cordeliers electoral
district of Paris&ndash;&ndash;the head of a popular
faubourg faction, not yet of power in
the State.</p>
<p>The new helmsmen of the State, headed
by Mirabeau, steered with considerable success
among waters as yet but partly roiled.
At Versailles an outward and visible Liberalism
triumphed. The Third Estate or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Commons, consolidating its authority as a
permanent assembly, took measures to end
the national bankruptcy and tried to cope
with the awful menace of starvation. It
was a bourgeois body, thinly sprinkled with
members of the nobility and clergy; its aim,
to abolish the worst seigniorial abuses, restore
prosperity, and support the throne by
a system of constitutional guarantees.</p>
<p>But when the Storm broke, it was not at
Versailles where these lawgiving Six Hundred
debated the state of the Nation, but at
Paris that the group known as &ldquo;Friends of
the People&rdquo; lashed the popular discontents
to unmeasured and ungovernable fury.</p>
<p>It begins in the Palais Royal where &ldquo;there
has been erected, apparently by subscription,
a kind of Wooden Tent, most convenient&ndash;&ndash;where
select Patriotism can now redact
resolutions, deliver harangues, with
comfort, let the weather be as it will. Lively
is that Satan-at-Home! On his table, on
his chair, in every cafe, stands a patriotic
orator; a crowd round him within; a crowd
listening from without, open-mouthed,
through open door and window; with
&lsquo;thunders of applause for every sentiment
of more than common hardiness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>Strange that in a Royalist garden should
sprout the seeds of a great Revolution!
Stranger the crowds that gathered there,
and the leaders both popular and Royalist&ndash;&ndash;among
the former, our fiery friend Danton,
our cautious, snuffling Robespierre,
and the boy of genius Camille Desmoulins,
Danton&rsquo;s &ldquo;slight-built comrade and craft-brother,
he with the long curling locks, with
the face of dingy blackguardism, wondrously
irradiated with genius!&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Lafayette and Minister from
America Thomas Jefferson came there too
now and again, to watch the crowds and
hear the speeches. Symbols of America&rsquo;s
newly won freedom, they were objects of
almost superstitious veneration to the agitators
for an enfranchised France. Danton,
Desmoulins and the rest crowded
around them, eager to shake their hands
and listen to their comments. In particular,
Lafayette&rsquo;s sword&ndash;&ndash;the gift of the
American Congress a decade before, excited
their admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From America&rsquo;s Congress!&rdquo; repeated
Danton fervently as he eyed the inscription
on the scabbard. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the kind of
Government we want over here!&rdquo; Tears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
came into the Frenchman&rsquo;s eyes, to think
of the Liberty that Lafayette had helped
to win.</p>
<p>The Palais Royal gardens were the property
of the King&rsquo;s cousin, Louis Phillipe.
Disgusted with not being in the councils of
the monarch and leaning to democracy, he
permitted the place to be used for public
promenades, lovers&rsquo; meetings&ndash;&ndash;and popular
harangues. Friends of the People, Friends
of Phillipe, and Friends of the King freely
rubbed elbows. The popular tide set so
strongly that none dared openly oppose the
demagogic orators. A bread famine had
descended upon Paris. The scarcity of
wheat and flour was an ever-present theme;
the oppression of autocracy and seigniorage,
another. The cry for direct action always
woke echo in the popular breast, sick
over the delays of the Versailles lawgivers,
and nourishing the hope of seizing pelf and
power, rescuing their kinsfolk from the
prisons, and beating down the Kingship
and aristocracy to relinquish privileges and
abate the hardships of the Common Man!</p>
<p>Plain, embittered envy stalked abroad,
too&ndash;&ndash;envy of the aristocrats&rsquo; grand homes
and unparalleled luxury, their fine equipages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
and clothing, costly foods and wines,
their trains of lackeys and menials, the
beauty and joie-de-vivre of their sons and
daughters! The mechanic, the storekeeper,
the unskilled laborer, the ranks of unemployed,
and the submerged tenth obliged to
live by their wits or starve, were as fuel to
the spark of the orators&rsquo; lightning.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas unlike a well-ordered land wherein
each one receives the well-merited reward
of toil. Justice was not in the body politic.
Tyranny, extravagance and bankruptcy on
the part of the ruling class had wiped out
the margin of plenty. Black ruin seemed to
impend for all. It was a case of starve&ndash;&ndash;or
unite against the rulers and oppressors of
society. Danton, the thunderer of mighty
speech, dominated these gatherings, aided
and abetted by the eagle-like Desmoulins
and the crafty Robespierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the People&rsquo;s government,&rdquo; his
swelling periods resounded, &ldquo;there shall be
no common man, no aristocrat&ndash;&ndash;no rich nor
poor&ndash;&ndash;but all brothers&ndash;&ndash;brothers&ndash;&ndash;brothers!&rdquo;
Imagine if you can the fire-drama of
his recital of generations of cruelties and
wrongs&ndash;&ndash;his picture of their miserable lot
and of the envied aristocrats&rsquo; pleasures&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
then consider the pitch of frenzied republicanism
to which this wonderful fraternal
climax uplifted them! With crash
of thunder and wrack of the elements the
Storm must break, directly the popular feeling
found immediate object of its ire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE ATTACK ON DANTON</h3>
</div>
<p>But the royalists were not idle. Their
spies attended the meetings. Their swordsmen
provoked street encounters with popular
leaders.</p>
<p>They had always coped with popular ferments
by picking off the individual leaders,
and they did not doubt their ability to do
the same thing now. As Danton spoke, an
influential Royalist, pretending to handclap
his sentiments, privately signaled to a number
of these &ldquo;spadassins&rdquo; or killers.</p>
<p>On his way home from the meeting Danton
was attacked in the lonely street. He
backed up to a house porch, quickly drew
his own sword, and with herculean strength
managed to cut down five or six spadassins
of the advance party.</p>
<p>Then he fled to the house where Henriette
and also Robespierre lodged, rushed
in and up the stairs. The following company
were almost upon him. Their shouts
and cries could be heard below.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>Danton plumped into the first door at the
left of the stair-head. He was there when
Henriette, who had been momentarily
away, returned to her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spies&ndash;&ndash;spadassins&ndash;&ndash;they would take
my life&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was wounded. It was with
a difficult hoarseness that he spoke.</p>
<p>The little homekeeper put a warning finger
to mouth. Running past him to the
door, she slipped out and closed it. She
withdrew to the back of the hall, and came
forward nonchalantly as the assassins
reached the hallway.</p>
<p>Rapier at her throat, the leader put the
silent but terrible question. Henriette&rsquo;s
heart jumped. She managed not to show
her terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a man going up those stairs three
steps at a time!&rdquo; she lied superbly, pointing
to the floor above.</p>
<p>The company ran up the third-floor stairs
on the double jump. As they vanished, she
was inside her rooms again and with the
quarry.</p>
<p>Minutes passed. The spadassins searched
the top garrets. They sought the roof, saw
escape was impossible that way. Then they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
clattered down the stairs. The leader hesitated
at Henriette&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The girl is just a
simpleton, she couldn&rsquo;t have tricked us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his command the men marched down&ndash;&ndash;to
encounter unexpectedly a company of
national gendarmes that had been hurriedly
summoned to the scene of the disturbance.</p>
<p>In the porch melee Danton&rsquo;s side had
been painfully slashed. Despite the pain,
he recognized his little preserver and
thanked her. Still holding his hand to his
side and half-reeling, he moved to go. Now
that all seemed quiet, he proposed to rid her
of the compromising presence of a man in
her room.</p>
<p>Henriette seized him with her little arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, you can&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; she said with a
little smile of divine pity. &ldquo;Better a little
gossip about me than that you should lose
your life.&rdquo; Henriette locked the door!</p>
<p>She strove to carry the disabled giant to
the nearest chair. Leaning heavily on her,
he walked with an effort and plumped down
on it. One of his arms was around her. She
tried to free it, but it clung. With hands
and knees she crawled out backward from
the unconscious embrace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>It was the work of but a few minutes to
wash and bind his wound. Next she spread
a pallet on the floor, assisted him to it,
wrapped him warmly, and with a kind
&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; left him to go to her little
boudoir....</p>
<p>That same night the spadassins were met
and disarmed by the gendarmes who
(largely owing to Danton&rsquo;s eloquence) espoused
the people&rsquo;s side. And that is why
Monsieur Robespierre, his confrere, was
abroad very early, without fear of assassins,
and nosing for news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear Danton was in a little trouble last
night!&rdquo; gossiped the slick citizen with his
landlady. &ldquo;The fight was in this very
house, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady, it seemed, was ignorant of
Danton&rsquo;s refuge. But Robespierre suspected.
He decided to investigate, being a
stickler for propriety. Mounting the stairs
stealthily, he knocked at Henriette&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>The girl and the man were at their leave-taking.
Few words were spoken. The
giant clasped both her little hands in his
great paws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have done for me I shall never
forget!&rdquo; he was saying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I had a great kind brother like
this!&rdquo; was her sudden thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisht!&rdquo; she whispered vocally as the
knock was heard. Again the little gesture
of warning finger to mouth.</p>
<p>She stole to the keyhole and thought she
recognized the habiliments of her neighbor
the dandy. Motioning Danton back out of
sight she opened the door on the crack,
closed it as she slipped through, and encountered
the bowing and smirking Robespierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man escaped from the spadassins here
last night-did he find refuge with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Monsieur. I am quite
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I just see? Very intimate friend
of mine, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you <i>may not</i>!&rdquo; Henriette quickly
reentered, and slammed and locked the door
on the future Dictator of France. &rsquo;Twas
only a little door slam, but it re-echoed later,
even at the Gates of Death! Rubbing his
long nose Robespierre took snuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h, he is still there!&rdquo; whispered the
girl to Danton, with another look through
keyhole. Presently steps were heard going
downstairs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is gone!&rdquo; she said, verifying
her statement by again opening the door
and finding the coast clear.</p>
<p>Danton, with a final good-by, went his
way.</p>
<p>The sneak, however, had retraced his
downstairs steps with cat-like tread. In an
alcove of the back hall he had found a hiding
post.</p>
<p>As Danton&rsquo;s broad back descended down
the steps, a vulpine head peered out of the
alcove, and Robespierre&rsquo;s cunning, self-satisfied
look showed that he recognized
Henriette&rsquo;s visitant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>LOUISE BEFORE NOTRE DAME</h3>
</div>
<p>In the days following her immurement in
the dreadful sub-cellar, Louise became the
Frochards&rsquo; breadwinner. Her pathetic
blindness, lovely face and form, and sweet
young voice attracted sympathy from each
passer-by. The offerings all went into the
capacious pocket of La Frochard, whence
indeed most of them were stolen or cajoled
by her worthless scamp of a Jacques.</p>
<p>The old hag feared only lest she lose her
precious acquisition of the blind girl. She
guarded her ceaselessly, and warded off dangerous
questioners.</p>
<p>It was not easy, however, to avoid the
good Doctor from La Force, who gave them
a donative and looked at the girl with deep
professional interest. Despite the beggar&rsquo;s
tactics, he insisted on examining the pupils,
then called La Frochard aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage her too much,&rdquo; said the
old gentlemen kindly, &ldquo;but bring her to me.
I am quite sure that she can be cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rejoining Louise and smiling her wheedling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
beggar&rsquo;s smile at the departing Doctor,
the features of Widow Frochard suddenly
contorted in black rage&ndash;&ndash;she shook her fist
at the physician directly his back was
turned. Monstrous&ndash;&ndash;to restore sight, and
thus make the girl worthless as object of
charity! La Frochard felt she had good
reason for her rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can the Doctor do anything?&rdquo; ventured
Louise to the hag, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he said your case is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were standing now near the snowy
steps of Notre Dame, awaiting worshippers
whose pity would be stirred by the girl&rsquo;s
misfortune. Half-drunken Jacques had
reeled out of a cabaret to exact his share of
the plunder. Mother and first-born cursed
heartily the scissors-grinder Pierre who
came limping up, saying he could get no
jobs on account of the bitter cold, wintry
day. Kicking the cripple and twisting
Louise&rsquo;s arm were the favorite pastimes of
Jacques and the Widow.</p>
<p>On this occasion the hag snatched the
covering from the wretched girl&rsquo;s shoulders
and put it around her own. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll shiver
better without that shawl!&rdquo; she said, brutally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
setting the scene for the worshippers&rsquo;
charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques and I,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;are going
to get a little drink to warm our frozen
bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard her there, you good-for-nothing
Pierre, or I&rsquo;ll break every bone of your
body!&rdquo; They departed to spend the Doctor&rsquo;s
gold-piece.</p>
<p>Pierre tried vainly to comfort the girl.
He could but find her a seat in a pile of
snow! He warmed her hands with his own,
strove to speak cheering words. But teeth
were chattering, and her frail form was
quivering as with the ague.</p>
<p>A great wave of pity and love overwhelmed
the cripple. He peeled off his coat,
beneath which were but the thinnest rags.
He wrapped it around her, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there! this will help you keep
warm. I really do not need it&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I-am-not-c-c-cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His own teeth were chattering now, and
his pinched features were purple.</p>
<p>The blind girl touched his icy arm, half
exposed by his ragged shirt, as she rose to
sing for the charity of those who attended
mass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Pierre,&rdquo; she cried, removing the
coat from her shoulders, &ldquo;I will not let you
freeze. Oh, how selfish I am to permit you
to suffer, who have been so kind to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rejecting his entreaties, she made him
put it on again, hiding her own suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearken! there sounds the organ for
the recessional!&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Soon the
people will be coming out. I will sing the
same songs that my sister Henriette and I
used to sing. Perhaps some one will recognize
the melody, and lead me back to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A beautifully majestic, ermined figure
stepped graciously out of the church, as La
Frochard rejoined Louise and began whining:
&ldquo;Charity! In the name of God, Charity!&rdquo;
whilst the girl&rsquo;s voice lifted up in an
old plaintive melody.</p>
<p>The lady was the Countess de Linieres,
returning from her devotions.</p>
<p>The song evoked memories of a bitter
past and of a long lost daughter snatched
from her in infancy. Bending over poor
Louise, she asked: &ldquo;My child, can you not
see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Madame, I am blind,&rdquo; was the low,
sad answer.</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>A strange sympathy stirred in the Countess
for this girl. There seemed to be some
hidden link between them, the nature of
which baffled her. She felt the impulse to
protect and cherish&ndash;&ndash;was it the voice of
Mother Love obscurely speaking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Louise. &ldquo;Blindness is not
the worst of my misfortunes. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Frochard administered a terrible pinch
that pulled Louise away, then &ldquo;mothered&rdquo;
her cutely. &ldquo;We are starving, my beautiful
lady,&rdquo; she whined, &ldquo;and the poor girl is out
of her head. What is that you say? <i>Not
my daughter?</i> Yes, indeed she is&ndash;&ndash;the precious&ndash;&ndash;and
the youngest of seven. Charity,
charity! In the name of God, charity!&rdquo;
she sniffled.</p>
<p>Reluctantly Countess de Linieres stifled
the impulse to mother this kindred and hapless
young being, averred to be the beggar&rsquo;s
daughter. She placed a golden louis on the
palm of the singer, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give this to your mother, child.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>LOVE, MASTER OF HEARTS</h3>
</div>
<p>The Count&rsquo;s demands brought to a head
a resolve that had taken possession of
Chevalier de Vaudrey&rsquo;s heart and soul. Always
the picture of the sweet Norman girl
he had saved from de Praille&rsquo;s foul clutches
was in his waking thoughts, of nights he
dreamed a blessed romance! He recked
not of the Count&rsquo;s displeasure, sorrowed
that he must displease his Aunt as sorely.
The only bar was that a vision of the lost
Louise stood, as it were, between him and
his beloved Henriette.</p>
<p>Now that he had come to her to speak of
his proposal, the little heart still quested for
the lost sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever think of anyone but
her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>A negative shake of the golden head and
ringleted curls was the answer, though the
cupid mouth and the blue eyes smiled with
tenderness. They stood very close to another,
like poles of a magnet twixt which a
spark flashes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>Silently Maurice drew from his pocket a
ring. &rsquo;Twas of pure gold, a lovely and exquisite
bauble, whereof the two little claws
clasped a golden heart. He handed it to
Henriette, who took it with a happy smile
till she realized its meaning as betrothal.</p>
<p>A wave of color overspread her cheek.
The heir of the de Vaudreys to give himself
to her! Pride and love mingled in her
thoughts.</p>
<p>Yes, to throw himself away on a Commoner
girl&ndash;&ndash;he meant it. Flashed the picture
on her mental retina of the little solemn
oath to Louise. What he asked was
impossible&ndash;&ndash;for him and for her.</p>
<p>Henriette handed back the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry you&ndash;&ndash;an aristocrat! Why, that
would ruin you in the eyes of <i>all the world</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was down on his knees, pleading,
agonized, distressed, looking for some sign
of relentment from the beauteous little
head that seemed rigidly to repress emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you d-o-n-&rsquo;t l-o-v-e m-e?&rdquo; he faltered
at last, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; was the reply, in a firm but very
small voice.</p>
<p>The broken Chevalier started slowly for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the door. He turned slightly and caught
the sound of sobs.</p>
<p>Wheeling around, he saw her arms half
stretched towards him. He bounded back.</p>
<p>He was now kissing the hem of her garments,
her gloves, her roses, her fingertips,
and crying extravagantly, almost shouting
the words: &ldquo;You DO love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently Henriette imparted a maiden&rsquo;s
delicate kiss on his cheek. &ldquo;When Louise
is found&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she was half sobbing in his
arms, &ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;dreams&ndash;&ndash;yes&ndash;&ndash;perhaps you might
find a way to bring them true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the gallant gentleman jumps forward
to the end of the dream. Youthfully
swearing that Louise will soon be found, he
visions their exquisite happiness as of tomorrow
or the day after. He holds her delightedly,
then draws her closer. The kindred
magnets are one.</p>
<p>Lips meet lips in soul-kiss that cause the
maidenly head to hide under elbow in confusion.
Kissing almost every part and furnishing
of that dear second self&ndash;&ndash;vowing
never to rest till he brings Louise and takes
Henriette&ndash;&ndash;the ecstatic cavalier is gone!</p>
<p>Alas for the quickly visioned dream-facts
of twenty-four! Full long shall be the interval
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
betwixt the bright Utopia and the
heavenly reality:&ndash;&ndash;the dungeon, the Storm,
the death chamber and e&rsquo;en the shining axe
shall intervene.</p>
<p>A great Nation shall have thrown off its
old tyrants and weltered in the blood of new
tyranny. What matter? The souls of the
girl and the man are one, they shall be faithful
unto the End!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE RECOGNITION</h3>
</div>
<p>The Chevalier de Vaudrey sought his
Aunt and begged her to see his beloved before
finally siding with the Count against
him. The incident of the chance encounter
with the blind girl had stirred the Countess,
awakened renewed pity for hapless love
such as she herself had once experienced.
She decided to visit Henriette, if only to
divert her from the seemingly mad project
of a union with the Chevalier.</p>
<p>Meantime Count Linieres had decided to
exercise the power of the dread lettres de
cachet. In the France of that day, personal
rights were unknown. Subject only to the
King&rsquo;s will, no other warrant than the Prefect&rsquo;s
signature was required to send anyone
into exile or to life imprisonment. The
means that Linieres now had in mind were
often used to quell rebellious lovers.</p>
<p>He would brand this inconvenient, presumptuous
Henriette Girard as a fallen
woman, imprison her at La Salpetriere, and
then ship her as a convict to Louisiana.
That would get rid of her, truly!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<p>In the meanwhile the Chevalier, if disobedient,
could cool his heels in the prison
tower of the royal fortress at Caen. After
a while, he might indeed see reason and
think better of marrying the Princesse de
Acquitaine!</p>
<p>He summoned the Chevalier. The autocratic
Count brooked no words; he commanded
marriage with the State heiress&ndash;&ndash;or
exile!</p>
<p>His nephew refusing, the guards were
summoned, the young man gave up his
sword, and under their escort he was presently
on his way to Caen prison.</p>
<p>Then, summoning a detail of military police,
the Count moved to carry out the other
part of his plan.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;You are Mademoiselle Henriette Girard?&rdquo;
inquired the Countess kindly on entering
the girl&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>
<p>Henriette greeted the distinguished and
aristocratic lady with due respect. Making
her comfortable in a guest chair, she resumed
her sewing and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the aunt of the Chevalier Maurice
de Vaudrey.&rdquo; The girl, startled, looked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
from her work. &ldquo;Marriage between you
and the Chevalier is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love him, Madame,&rdquo; replied Henriette,
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is your duty to give him up,
since it is the will of the King that he marry
Princesse de Acquitaine&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette paled. For an instant the blue
eyes looked near-tigerish, with green and
yellow lights. Yet she must save Maurice
from the King&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will make this sacrifice,&rdquo; continued
the Countess, &ldquo;I shall not prove ungrateful
with any reward that is in my
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there is!&rdquo; replied Henriette
earnestly. She showed the Countess her
sampler, on which she was working the
word&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='center'>LOUISE</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise&ndash;&ndash;that name is very dear to me,&rdquo;
replied the Lady softly. She visioned a
scene of long ago when an infant Louise
had been snatched from her young arms&ndash;&ndash;the
arms of a mother deprived of her offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; resumed Henriette&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;lost,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
wandering and alone, on the streets
of Paris. Oh, help me find her, and I&ndash;&ndash;I
will do anything you say!&rdquo; The poor creature
sobbed in her double misery.</p>
<p>She pointed to her own eyes in gesture to
portray Louise&rsquo;s misfortune: &ldquo;Blind&ndash;&ndash;so
helpless&ndash;&ndash;it was just like taking care of a
baby.&rdquo; She told the story of her abduction
and the loss of her sister, then of Chevalier
de Vaudrey&rsquo;s vain efforts and hers to trace
her.</p>
<p>The Countess de Linieres leaned forward
in intense sympathy conjoined with a certain
weird premonition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t really my sister,&rdquo; went on Henriette,
&ldquo;but I owe her the love of a mother
and sister combined. She saved us from
want and death. My father found her on
the steps of Notre Dame&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low cry escaped the Countess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;where he was about to put me as a
foundling, there not being a morsel of food
in our wretched home. This other baby
was half buried under the snow. He
warmed the little bundle against his body
and mine&ndash;&ndash;and, rather than let us perish
there of the cold, returned homeward with
both infants in his arms. Suspended from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the other baby&rsquo;s neck were a bag of gold
and this locket&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess gasped. She put a hand
to her heart and seemed about to faint before
recovering strength to examine the
locket that Henriette handed to her.</p>
<p>It was a miniature that the Prefect&rsquo;s wife
recognized as her own!</p>
<p>Opened, it disclosed an aged and yellowed
bit of paper, on which the writing was still
visible:</p>
<p class='center'>HER NAME IS LOUISE<br />
SAVE HER</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! My own Louise!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;lost, wandering and blind in Paris. Tell
me, tell me&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She had almost fainted.
The floodgate of tears relieved her pent
heart.</p>
<p>Henriette was bending over her now, her
arm around her shoulders, trying to comfort.</p>
<p>But the girl herself was near the breaking
point. The voice of the loved and absent
one seemed to sound in her ears.</p>
<p>Was it an hallucination?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singing,&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; said Henriette,
softly, to the Mother.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>The girl brushed a hand across her eyes
and tapped her temple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my dreams oft I hear it, my sister&rsquo;s
voice. I must be losing my reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again swelled the notes of the Norman
melody, and this time the Mother heard
too.</p>
<p>The two sprang to their feet.</p>
<p>Henriette dashed to balcony window. At
the end of the street she saw a figure clad
in beggar&rsquo;s rags that she thought she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;LOUISE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette&rsquo;s cry echoed down the street
and impinged on the blind beggar&rsquo;s brain.
The outcast ran groping and stumbling forward,
no longer singing, but calling &ldquo;Henriette!&rdquo;
Her keeper, Widow Frochard, was
not in sight.</p>
<p>The blind girl came nearer. Frochard
emerged from a ginshop and tried to head
her off. The Mother followed Henriette to
the window. The latter encouraged Louise
with little cries:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down in one instant!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>She rushed past the Countess across the
room and flung wide the door, on the very
brink of happiness.</p>
<p>But a troop of guards stood there to her
astonished gaze. The Count de Linieres,
standing at their head, pronounced her
name as if reading a warrant: &ldquo;Henrietta
Girard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew back, then charged like a
little fury on the gunstocks and bosoms of
the troopers, pounding them with her fists.</p>
<p>Unable to move this granite-like wall, she
dashed back to the balcony eyrie, imploring
Louise with both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest her!&rdquo; said de Linieres to the soldiers.</p>
<p>Brawny troopers pulled her back as she
would have jumped out of the window to
the flagging below&ndash;&ndash;and her Louise. Vainly
the Countess de Linieres entreated for
mercy. They dragged the girl downstairs.</p>
<p>Here again she made a frantic appeal and
wild effort to join her blind charge, who was
being hurried away in the vise-like grip of
La Frochard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, have pity&ndash;&ndash;let
me go to my sister, or I shall lose her
again!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>Deaf to her entreaties, they took her to
La Salpetriere, this loveliest of virgins, to
be immured among the foul characters
there!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>DOWN IN THE DEPTHS</h3>
</div>
<p>With Henrietta condemned to the cruel
fate of immurement in a prison for the fallen,
the Chevalier trussed up in royal Caen,
and his aunt the Countess prostrated by the
hag&rsquo;s recapture of and disappearance with
the noblewoman&rsquo;s long-lost daughter, blind
Louise, &rsquo;twould seem as if our characters
faced indeed blank walls of ruin, misery and
despair, from which no power could rescue
them.</p>
<p>In those times, the utter vanishing of persons
who incurred police disfavor was no
uncommon incident. Often no public
charge was made; merely the gossiped
whisper that So-and-So lay in Bastille or
La Salpetriere &ldquo;at the royal pleasure,&rdquo; kept
the unfortunate faintly in memory till the
lapse of years caused him or her to be forgotten.
And, sometimes, even, at the prison
gate, identity vanished. Did not the celebrated
and mysterious Man in the Iron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
Mask carry his baffling secret through decades
of dungeon death-in-life to the prisoner&rsquo;s
dark grave?</p>
<p>Others were silently transported to exile
overseas. As England had her Botany Bay,
so France had Louisiana. Let us take a
glance at La Salpetriere (as Henriette is being
dragged there by Count de Linieres&rsquo;
troopers) to look at the sights and scenes of
the famous female prison, and contemplate
what the inmates had in store.</p>
<p>There was no interesting toil to relieve
their unhappy lot, and no distinction was
made of the insane, the law-breaking criminal,
and the wretched streetwalker or demimondaine.
In the courtyard, during the
exercise periods, the only talk was of the
terms of imprisonment and of the chances
of Louisiana. In that gray monotony the
ministrations of the charitable Sisters,
headed by the saintly Sister Genevieve (who
had been born within the walls of the
prison), furnished the one bright spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not grieve so!&rdquo; said one of the older
inmates who had begged a little needlework,
to a novice who was seated on a
bench, weeping convulsively with her head
in her arms.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can never live such a life as this!&rdquo;
replied the poor girl, giving way to new
grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to do something or other, &rsquo;twill
make you forget your troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done anything in my life&ndash;&ndash;except
amuse myself!&rdquo; replied the ex-grisette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be precious hard work in
this place,&rdquo; said a third speaker, who had
passed several years of the dreary inactions
of prison life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I&rsquo;ve had my fling!&rdquo; remarked
the newcomer, drying her eyes.
&ldquo;Scores of admirers crowded around me,
willing to ruin themselves for my amusement&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she said in a vivacious manner, as
she recalled her past triumphs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it all peters down to prison, eating
gruel with a wooden spoon,&rdquo; said the cynical
old-timer; &ldquo;then, some day, we shall be
treated as those poor creatures were yesterday&ndash;&ndash;hurried
off with a guard of soldiers
to see us safe on our weary exile&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the idea of exile frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who would not be frightened at the idea
of being led off amid insults and jeers&ndash;&ndash;condemned
to a two months&rsquo; voyage in the
vilest company&ndash;&ndash;and at the end of it be
landed in a wild country to face the alternatives
of slavery or a runaway into the savage
swamps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of work to relieve monotony&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say women are scarce out there in
Louisiana. Perhaps I shall get a husband,
and revenge myself on the male creation
that way&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their speculations were cut short by the
entry of a squad of troopers literally dragging
tiny Henriette Girard within the
prison walls. Cold and unfeeling at best,
these men had no sympathy with their
young charge whom they naturally believed
to be one of the harpies or half-wits
caught in the police dragnet. They thrust
her mid the crowd in the courtyard and departed.
The great iron doors clanged shut.
The gatekeeper turned the massive key.
Henriette&ndash;&ndash;without a friend in the world
to appeal to&ndash;&ndash;was an inmate of dread La
Salpetriere!</p>
<p>Like a flock of magpies the imprisoned
demi-mondaines, petty thieves, and grosser
criminals for love or for hate, crowded
around the girl, inquiring what offence had
brought her amongst them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her little sobbing cry of self-justification
was received with jibes and winks. Was
not such the formula of every prisoner?
They pressed her for her story. Looking
at these ignoble spirits, the girl could not
bear to acquaint them with her pure and
holy romance.</p>
<p>As she turned away, a new shock met her
gaze.</p>
<p>Faugh! What was this physical weakness,
this nausea-like repulsion, but the
bodily reaction from the tense spiritual
agony she had suffered?</p>
<p>Courage! She must look again. That
wild woman&ndash;&ndash;hair down, breath gasping,
arms weaving threateningly&ndash;&ndash;was coming
at her like a murderess. Momentarily Henriette
expected the long arms to seize her,
the steel-like hands and wrists to choke her.</p>
<p>She looked yet a third time. The crazy
&ldquo;murderess&rdquo; had veered her course, but
what was that other object nearby? A
Niobe weeping for her own and the world&rsquo;s
sorrows! Or this one over here&ndash;&ndash;a shrieking
maniac calling on all Hell&rsquo;s legions for
vengeance on fancied enemies! Beyond,
gibbering victims of paresis, white-haired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
idiots, wasted sufferers from senile dementia.</p>
<p>Not a friendly face, not a kind look nor
an understanding eye! Crime, passion,
foulness, insanity. The sheer horror of her
situation mercifully blotted out consciousness.
She sank, a crumpled heap to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is sick,&rdquo; said Sister Genevieve,
who had entered at this moment and was
presently bending over her. &ldquo;Here, two of
you lift her and carry her into the hospital&ndash;&ndash;we
shall have the good Doctor from La
Force attend her!&rdquo; Two of the sturdier
prisoners bore her away....</p>
<p>Beautiful, pitiful Henriette!</p>
<p>The horrors of the madwomen thou
facest in Salpetriere; the obscene shouts
and curses of the fallen; the fury of the female
criminal; the misery of the poor distracted
half-wits, where mad and sane are
given the same cell:&ndash;&ndash;these shall be but confused
phantasmagoria projected on thy sick
brain during this prison time before the
awful Storm breaks&ndash;&ndash;the lightning strikes&ndash;&ndash;the
thunder crashes, and the sharp female
called La Guillotine holds thee in its embrace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>LIGHT RAYS IN THE DARKNESS</h3>
</div>
<p>Henriette was nursed through a severe
mental and bodily illness by Sister Genevieve
directed by the visiting prison Doctor,
none other than him who had examined
the eyes of Louise before Notre Dame.</p>
<p>During this period it was quite impossible
for the attendants to get her story.
She herself in lucid moments could hardly
realize her situation, nor in any wise remember
how she had come to it.</p>
<p>But one day new strength seemed to be
hers. Feverish and with hair unbound and
a wild light in her eyes, she sprang out of
her cot, sought Genevieve in the main
prison, and knelt before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madame!&rdquo; cried Henriette in imploring
accents, &ldquo;if you are the mistress
here, have pity on me, and order them to set
me free. I ask you on my knees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still ill, my child,&rdquo; said Sister
Genevieve tenderly, stroking Henriette&rsquo;s,
long hair with a gentle, loving touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you are,&rdquo; confirmed the Doctor,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
who was just then on his way to the
hospital ward. &ldquo;Why have you left your
bed without my permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, monsieur!&rdquo; said the poor girl, turning
to the gentle-voiced, pleasant-faced man
who spoke so kindly, &ldquo;have you attended
me in my illness? Look&ndash;&ndash;thanks to your
care&ndash;&ndash;I have recovered!&rdquo; she affirmed confidently,
though her hectic features and
weak motions belied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They left me alone for a few moments,
and I arose and dressed myself. Now that
you see I am quite well, you will tell them
to let me go, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor gazed at her compassionately
before answering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible. To release you from
this place requires a far greater power than
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place?&rdquo; asked the young girl in surprise.
&ldquo;Why, what is it? Is it not a hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hospital and a prison,&rdquo; replied the
physician gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prison!&rdquo; exclaimed Henriette in terror,
striving to remember how she came to
be in such a place.</p>
<p>At last the events that preceded her illness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
gradually came back to her mind, until
she understood all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I remember,&rdquo; she said at length.
&ldquo;Yes, I remember the soldiers who dragged
me here, and him who commanded....
And Maurice&ndash;&ndash;was he too condemned?
Alas, poor Louise&ndash;&ndash;my last sight of her
showed her in the power of vile, unscrupulous
wretches! Oh, dear God, what have I
done to be crushed like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped, weeping and wailing, to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said the Doctor, turning away
to hide his tears, &ldquo;this is not a case for my
care. You must be the physician here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know virtue and innocence when I see
it, surely this child has done nothing worthy
of a term at Salpetriere!&rdquo; replied the kind
Genevieve softly, lifting up the stricken girl
and embracing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, dear, you must rest yet a little
longer in order to acquire the full strength
so as to be able to tell me everything. Assuredly
we will help you!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the course of convalescence Henriette
told her complete story to Sister Genevieve.
The narrative included the girls&rsquo; journey to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
Paris, her kidnapping and rescue, the disappearance
of Louise, de Vaudrey&rsquo;s suit and
the objections of his family, the recognition
of her sister as the Countess&rsquo;s long-lost
daughter, Louise&rsquo;s recapture by the beggars,
and the peremptory act of the Police
Prefect whereby mother and daughter, and
beloved foster-sisters, were cruelly parted,
and Henriette branded with the mark of
the fallen woman by incarceration in La
Salpetriere.</p>
<p>Sister Genevieve was strangely moved by
it, as was the Doctor to whom she repeated it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the will of the Police Prefect
we can do nothing!&rdquo; said the Doctor, soberly.
&ldquo;If only his wrath has cooled, we
may possibly get her term shortened&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What monstrous wickedness!&rdquo; interrupted
the Sister, ordinarily mild and loyal,
but worked up to near-democracy by these
and other injustices. &ldquo;To imprison a pure
girl&ndash;&ndash;her only offence a nobleman&rsquo;s honorable
suit and her own ceaseless search for
her blind sister, lost in the streets of Paris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl Henriette was her blind sister&rsquo;s
sole support,&rdquo; suggested a nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had found her&ndash;&ndash;Louise&ndash;&ndash;at the moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
when they arrested me,&rdquo; exclaimed
Henriette sorrowfully. &ldquo;I heard her voice.
I saw her. She was covered with rags. Her
beautiful golden hair fell in disorder on her
shoulders. She was being dragged along
by a horrible old woman, who I know ill-treats
her&ndash;&ndash;beats her, perhaps, and they
would not let me go to her. Now I have
lost her forever&ndash;&ndash;forever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, my child,&rdquo; exclaimed the
physician, as a sudden thought flashed over
him. &ldquo;I believe I have met that very same
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, monsieur?&rdquo; exclaimed Henriette
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes, a young girl led by an old
woman who calls her Louise&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes, that&rsquo;s her name,&rdquo; and the
young girl became breathless with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the old woman, too,&rdquo; continued
the Doctor. &ldquo;She is called La Frochard&ndash;&ndash;an
old hag who goes about whining for alms
in the name of Heaven and seven small
children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did I last see them?&rdquo; he mused.
Suddenly he recollected a little scene on the
steps of Notre Dame one morning before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
mass. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;they were
begging for charity of the churchgoers at
Notre Dame. I noticed that the young girl
was blind&ndash;&ndash;professionally interested, I examined
her pupils and discovered she was
merely suffering from cataracts which
could be readily removed. I told the old
woman so, asked her to bring the girl for
treatment to La Force, but they have never
shown up&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Quick!&rdquo; cried Henriette. &ldquo;Tell
me, Doctor, where Mere Frochard lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they inhabit an old boathouse at the
end of the Rue de Brissac down on the
banks of the river Seine. There&rsquo;s a cellar
entrance to their hovel near the Paris-Normandy
coach house. But what would you
do?&rdquo; he inquired solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sir,&rdquo; said Henriette piteously, &ldquo;if
you could use your influence to get me out
of here some way, I would&ndash;&ndash;would run
there and recover my little lost sister! You
don&rsquo;t know how I love her, nor my fears
that they will kill her. Please, please&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
The little voice broke off in sobs.</p>
<p>Patting the girl&rsquo;s shoulder and smiling at
her as if to try to impart confidence in a
very difficult matter, the good Doctor drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
apart with Sister Genevieve and conferred
earnestly for a few moments. On their return,
the physician spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be of no use to invoke the police,
as the Count has probably instructed
them not to hunt for Louise. Nor is it in
our power to release you from here. But
we shall get up a petition signed by all of
us for your reprieve, very likely Count de
Linieres will not venture to refuse it&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette was overjoyed even with this
slender resource, and warmly thanked them.
At once her busy little brain laid plans for
invading the lair of the Frochards. And
then&ndash;&ndash;a most unexpected ray in the darkness&ndash;&ndash;arrived
at Salpetriere the quaint
valet Picard and brought her comfort too.</p>
<p>No longer a spy for the Count, he had
been converted from base suspicion by the
Chevalier&rsquo;s honorable suit and the exile the
latter had suffered. He now delivered this
little message from his master at Caen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dearest, never will I marry anyone but you, my
heart&rsquo;s desire! Should I escape, it will be to your arms.
Picard knows my secret plan and will tell you&ndash;&ndash;until
then, courage! A thousand kisses from your Maurice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henriette kissed the little paper fervently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>Countess de Linieres decided to make a
clean breast of her wretched past to her
husband. &ldquo;It was not that I&ndash;&ndash;I sinned,&rdquo; she
sobbed, kneeling at his feet, &ldquo;In the sight
of God I am innocent, though erring!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In early girlhood,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I
loved and was loved by a Commoner, a man
of the people. The good Cure married us
secretly. We were blessed by an infant
daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family pride of the de Vaudreys was
outraged by the so-called dishonor. Two
of the clan found our hiding-place and slew
my husband, then took my baby Louise
from my helpless arms. I was brought back
to the chateau and given in marriage to you,
after threats of death if I should ever divulge
the secret! Twenty years after, I
saw my daughter as Louise the blind singer&ndash;&ndash;the
girl Henriette, whom you sent to Salpetriere,
is her foster-sister. Oh, forgive,
forgive&ndash;&ndash;put me away if you wish, but consider
what I have suffered!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strong man, whom neither the fate
of Maurice nor of Henriette had melted,
was crying. Gently he lifted up the Countess
and clasped her sobbing in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had only told me before&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the only word to which he could give utterance.</p>
<p>The hellish aspect of his persecutions
now stood revealed. Count de Linieres, in
the act of divine forgiveness, resolved to
undo wrongs.</p>
<p>But History struck faster.</p>
<p>The avenger Jacques-Forget-Not annihilated
pardons. The Linieres and the other
aristocrats were soon to flee for their lives.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>REVOLUTION IS HERE!</h3>
</div>
<p>The ex-retainer nicknamed &ldquo;Forget-Not&rdquo;
bore a baleful grudge because of the cruelties
inflicted on his own father many years
before by the Countess&rsquo;s father&ndash;&ndash;the cruel
punishment of pouring boiling lead into the
unfortunate tenant&rsquo;s veins: a procedure
on which the boy Chevalier had been taught
to look approvingly.</p>
<p>In fact ever since the elder Jean Setain
displeased the then Seigneur of the de Vaudrey
estate, the affairs of the tenant family
had gone to wrack and ruin until the middle-aged
son was little more than a landless
beggar and an embodied voice calling for
vengeance.</p>
<p>The original parties of the quarrel were
dead. But the feud (on the part of Jacques-Forget-Not)
had taken on a more personal
aspect, because his own sufferings were involved
as well as the memory of his father&rsquo;s.
He had determined to kill the Chevalier,
the Countess and the Count.</p>
<p>In normal times the monomaniac&rsquo;s designs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
would never have reached fruition.
Now the vast public discontents converted
the cringing ex-tenant or shrieking beggar
into a gaunt, long-haired, ferocious agitator&ndash;&ndash;one
of the outstanding crazy figures
of Great Crises!</p>
<p>For the Storm&ndash;&ndash;long brewing in seditious
Palais Royal or seething faubourg,
in the heart and conscience of patriot Dantons,
the cunning of Robespierres, the wildness
of Desmoulins fire-eaters, the starvation
and misery of the people&ndash;&ndash;struck the
doomed country with full force.</p>
<p>In the outcome the fat King Louis XVI,
the hapless royal family, and the whole supporting
system of parasitic aristocracy,
were hurled down into black nothingness!
The upset released our characters from the
horrors of prison immurement, only to
plunge them in the more awful tyranny of
the New Terror.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Early in midsummer the wildest rumors
reached Paris that the Versailles government
intended to put down the discontents
by weight of sword. Armies were advancing
on the city, &rsquo;twas averred&ndash;&ndash;cannon and
arms were being parked in the commanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
squares; the King&rsquo;s faithful Allemands and
Swiss were about to attack the representatives
of the people and mow them down.</p>
<p>As a beehive, stirred by over-curious bear
or by an invader&rsquo;s stick, seethes and swarms
in milling fury before the myriads of angry
occupants attack and overwhelm the intruder
with their stings, so the seething
populace mills in widening and ever widening
circles, out to destroy&ndash;&ndash;burn&ndash;&ndash;slay. The
ominous drum murmurs to the people of
their ancient wrongs. Artisans pick up
their nearest implements, the butcher his
axe, the baker his rolling pin, the joiner his
saw, the iron worker his mallet or crowbar,
rushing to join the homicidal throngs.
Vengeful leaders like Forget-Not urge them
on, directing the milling masses to the central
places of the city.</p>
<p>At the Palais Royal gardens, later from
the Cafe de Foy, Camille Desmoulins is in
his glory. See him rushing out, sibylline
in face; his hair streaming, in each hand a
pistol! He springs to a table: the police
satellites are eyeing him; alive they shall
not take him; not they alive, him alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends, shall we die like hunted
hares? Us, meseems, only one cry befits:
To arms! Let universal Paris, universal
France, as with the throat of the whirlwind,
resound: To arms! Friends (continues
Camille) some rallying sign! Cockades,
green one; the color of hope!&rsquo; As
with the flight of locusts, these green
leaves; green ribands from the neighboring
shops; all green things are snatched and
made cockades of.... And now to
Curtius&rsquo; image shop there; to the boulevards;
to the four winds, and rest not until
France be on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ancient flint-locks, pikes and lances are
replevined, and dance high, minatory, over
the heads of the mob. Storerooms of powder
and musketry are broken into and
swept clean. Behold, now, a still more astonishing
sight; a rushing tide of women,
impetuous, all-devouring, equipped with
brooms and household tools, descending
like a snowbreak from all directions upon
the Hotel de Ville. &ldquo;And now doors fly under
hatchets; the Judiths have broken the
armory; have seized guns and cannon,
three money-bags,&rdquo; and have fired the
beautiful City Hall of King Henry the
Fourth&rsquo;s time!</p>
<p>... And where the Storm breaks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
fiercest and the cry &ldquo;Down with Tyrants!&rdquo;
most loudly sounds, there Danton the
revolutionist, the pock-marked Thunderer,
leads the way, whipping up new fury and
moulding them to his will with his appeal
&rsquo;gainst &ldquo;Starvation&ndash;&ndash;oppression&ndash;&ndash;ages of
injustice&ndash;&ndash;vile prisons where innocent
ones die under autocracy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danton&rsquo;s voice shakes the world.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of commoners
gather for the attack on the hated symbol
of royal authority, the prison fortress
of Bastille.</p>
<p>Look! His impassioned eloquence
touches the popular sympathies of the
common soldiers who constitute the royal
guard. They lower their opposing bayonets,
identify their cause with the people&rsquo;s,
the exultant throng rushes past.</p>
<p>Hurrah! The Revolution shall sweep on.
The King&rsquo;s foreign soldiery are the only
loyal ones now. At the side of the Place
de Greve the populace throw up barricades.
The conflict twixt Kingship and democracy
has begun.</p>
<p>The people have won more cannon and
more small arms. They rake the loyalist
Swiss and Germans with a murderous fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
The foreign troops fight to the last. They
are killed or overwhelmed as the victorious
commonalty take possession of the Square.
Danton who has directed the proletariat is
the popular hero.</p>
<p>Forget-Not has his share of the triumph
too. &ldquo;Come, my men,&rdquo; he yells. &ldquo;On to
the Police Prefect&rsquo;s palace&ndash;&ndash;let us avenge
the wrongs of police tyranny!&rdquo; For in
this dreadful hour the baleful Jacques-Forget-Not
remembers a private vengeance&ndash;&ndash;his
followers need no second urging to
haste with him to sack and slaughter....</p>
<p>Fox-like, Maximilien Robespierre, the
&ldquo;people&rsquo;s advocate,&rdquo; has watched from a
safe recess the issue of the battle. Not for
him, the risking of his precious skin!
Later, in the councils of the new democratic
State, he shall sway men to his purposes....</p>
<p>And now the mob, re-enforced by many
of the popular soldiery, seeks the Bastille.
Our previous description of the system of
lettres de cachet and the wholesale imprisonments
without warrant of law, will
have given readers some idea of the hate
with which this fortress of injustice was
commonly regarded. Many of the attackers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
no doubt, had friends or relatives immured
there. &rsquo;Twas the monstrous and visible
crime of the Kingship&ndash;&ndash;the object all had
immediately in view when crying &ldquo;Down
with tyranny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than a day the Bastille falls.
&rsquo;Tis but feebly defended by a few aged
veterans and a handful of valiant Swiss.
Their first fire kills some of the commoners
and lashes the mob to fury. Up on the
walls, bastions and parapets, away from the
guns at the port holes, crawl some of the
more daring attackers. Others bring cannon,
preparing to carry the siege by cannonade,
investiture and starvation.</p>
<p>The governor, seeing that it is a losing
fight, parleys and yields. But, instead of
observing the terms of the honorable surrender
and safe-conduct, the inrushing mob
slays and mutilates a number of the officers
and defenders&ndash;&ndash;the first inkling of what
murder and rapine the Wild Beast of the
Proletariat will commit!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set free the victims of the tyrants!&rdquo; is
the sole thought after the lust of blood is
satiated. The dungeons are opened, the
prisoners brought forth, joy of reunion or
pathos of sorrow is the result of these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
strange meetings, many of the victims being
but the wrecks or shadows of their old
selves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set free the victims of tyranny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Bastille La Salpetriere, the
famous female prison, is summoned. Already
the inmates are on the qui vive of
expectation. Mad and sane are flying about
from cells to courtyard, and courtyard to
barred windows, like birds in storm-flight.</p>
<p>Impatient, restless little Henriette, between
the bars of her cage, is looking out
wonderingly on a re-made world. What
does it mean? Release? the easy path to
her lost Louise?</p>
<p>Pray Heaven it does&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>PRISON DELIVERY&ndash;&ndash;AND AN ENCOUNTER</h3>
</div>
<p>The jailers deliver the keys; the mob
pours tumultuously into the female prison.
What cries of joy, what sobs of relief from
the saner inmates, as they try to <i>think</i> their
new, almost incredible jail delivery! What
stony, uncomprehending glances or what
wild shrieks from the maniacal! Amid this
confused throng Picard, who has entered
with the crowd to wait upon his mistress,
presents a comic figure. He has arrayed
himself in the red-and-white striped garb
of the proletariat, is trying his best to look
a Revolutionary, though all he gets for it
are kicks and wallops!</p>
<p>Sense and nonsense mix strangely in the
proceedings of the mob. They set up a
rude court headed by two horny-handed
butchers, the object of which is to separate
the innocent from the guilty. But the new
red-and-white cockade&ndash;&ndash;superseding the
green cockades of the first battle&ndash;&ndash;is the
best passport to their favor. Inmates
whose friends have provided them with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
these Revolutionary badges, are generally
turned loose. Shouting and laughing in
their glee, they dance out of the prison.</p>
<p>Picard has provided Henriette with his
badge, whilst Sister Genevieve and the
Doctor vouch to her good character. Henriette
kisses the cockade as a sign of fealty
to the new order. The brawny judges let
her pass. She runs merrily out past the
harmless gauntlet of the friendly pikes and
lances.</p>
<p>Not so Picard&ndash;&ndash;That luckless valet
tries to sneak out past the big chopper of
the brawny butcher-judge.</p>
<p>Whir-r! The chopper descends in front
of him, almost taking his head off!</p>
<p>Picard executes a strategic retirement to
the rear. There! Isn&rsquo;t there seemingly a
good chance to crawl out between the other
guardian&rsquo;s legs, and thus escape?</p>
<p>Picard tries it.</p>
<p>Alas! the first butcher catches sight of
Picard&rsquo;s be-tufted head protruding in this
strange manner from under the crotch of
his fellow. The Man of Meat grasps Picard
firmly by the collar and pulls him forth.</p>
<p>With the other hand he raises the axe
to chop the offender&rsquo;s head off, thinks better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
of it, twirls Picard swiftly around, and
using the flat of the chopper spanks the
rear of the Picard anatomy, sending him
sprawling into the limbo.</p>
<p>So that little Henriette&rsquo;s excursion into
Freedom is unattended and alone. It is
quite unlikely that she bothers about Picard
at all. &ldquo;Louise! Rue de Brissac!&rdquo; is the
sole thought of her whirling little brain, as
she speeds on.</p>
<p>Just where is the Frochards&rsquo; cellar door?
Certainly she has never noticed it in her
frequent searches of the Pont Neuf district.
But perhaps some one can tell her&ndash;&ndash;She
is in the Rue de Brissac now, almost at the
spot where she herself was kidnapped and
Louise was lost.</p>
<p>A good-looking daughter of the people
comes hurrying by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where the Frochards
live?&rdquo; inquires Henriette eagerly.</p>
<p>The girl points to an almost indistinguishable
trap-door, nearly covered with
straw, in front of one of the houses.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she says. Henriette presses the
newcomer to accompany her. &ldquo;Sorry, I
haven&rsquo;t a minute!&rdquo; negatives the other, hastening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
off in spite of Henriette&rsquo;s efforts to
detain her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Henriette opens the trap-door of the cellar
where the Frochards lodged, and peers
within. Courageously she goes down the
steps. Sympathy and horror struggle in
the thought of Louise being an inmate of
this foul place.</p>
<p>What is her disgust then to encounter
the wart-faced and moustachioed hag who
is its proprietor! Quickly Henriette tells
La Frochard of her information, and demands
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any such person,&rdquo; the hag
lies, with ready effrontery. &ldquo;You must be
mistaken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Henriette&rsquo;s eyes are gazing at the
Frochard&rsquo;s neck, sensing something or
other vaguely familiar. The old woman,
who has been drinking, has unloosened her
nondescript rig. The girl&rsquo;s gaze sees a
well-remembered object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s shawl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue eyes are gleaming now in astonishment&ndash;&ndash;with
a hint of coming fury.
She snatches the shawl from La Frochard&rsquo;s
shoulders, fondles and caresses it. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
like a small tigress robbed of whelp she
advances on the beggar, shaking her in
paroxysmal rage.</p>
<p>It would have been a comical sight if not
so very serious a one; the tiny Henrietta
shaking a woman twice her size, pummeling
her, brow-beating her till La Frochard
sinks to her knees and begs for mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been lying, and that shawl
proves it,&rdquo; cries Henriette. &ldquo;Where is
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman gets up. She changes
her tone to a whine, and tries to pat Henriette
in pretended sympathy. &ldquo;Well, if
you must know the truth&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cries Henriette, &ldquo;go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;she <i>was</i> with us, but alas!&ndash;&ndash;poor
thing&ndash;&ndash;with the hard life we have to lead&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;she
died!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The searcher for Louise reels as if about
to faint.</p>
<p>She collects herself with difficulty, and
stares at La Frochard. A distraught look
is on the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>It is a look of utter misery, compounded
with mistrustfulness of the deceiving hag.</p>
<p>She leaves the cellar, fully resolved to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
invoke the Law&ndash;&ndash;if Law&ndash;&ndash;in this wild time&ndash;&ndash;there
can be found...</p>
<p>A bundle of rags, on which Henrietta
has almost stepped in passing, moves very
slightly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;THERE IS NO LAW&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>The wild and drunken madness of the
triumphant people expended itself in many
strange forms, of which none was stranger,
more awesome, more ludicrous and yet
more tragic than the Carmagnole.</p>
<p>This was a dance that seized whole multitudes
in its rhythmic, swaying clutch. The
tune was &ldquo;Ca Ira!&rdquo; that mad measure of
the sansculottes, meaning roughly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Here it goes&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;And there it goes!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;and go forever it did till all the world
of Paris seemed a heaving, throbbing vortex
of werewolves and witches, things lower
than animals in their topsyturvydom,
drunken frenzy and frequent obscenity.</p>
<p>The throng through which Henriette
now directed her steps was verging on this
madness, though not yet at the pitch of it.</p>
<p>Henriette managed to find her way to
two sansculotte troopers stationed in the
centre of the Place, to whom she told her
story. Reasonable fellows they seemed, offering
to conduct her presently to the new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
authorities and get a search warrant for the
Frochard clan. But the madder swirl of
the Carmagnole came along, and presto!
swallowed them up. It happened on this
wise:</p>
<p>As the locust swarms of the dancers enveloped
them in shortening circles, two
young and attractive maenads broke from
the throng and literally entwined themselves
with the troopers. Military dignity,
assaulted in burlesque, tried to keep
its post. But the bold nymphs were
clinging, not to be &ldquo;shaken&rdquo;; as the mad
whirl of the dancers touched the centre,
the troopers and their female captors were
borne away in the ricocheting, plunging
motions, disappearing thenceforward from
our story. Little Henriette dived to a place
of safety, the side wall of the nearest building.
Straightening herself after the unexpected
knocks and bruises, she looked
aghast at the scene before her.</p>
<p>Whole streets of them, plazas of them,
these endlessly gyrating male and female
loons; swirls of gayety, twisting, upsetting
passers-by like a cyclone;&ndash;&ndash;arms, bodies
and legs frantically waving, as at the very
brink of Dante&rsquo;s Inferno!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>Strange little dramas of lust and conquest
punctuated the cyclonic panorama.
Here, a girl&rsquo;s snapping black eyes, winking
devilishly, and pursed-up Cupid mouth invited
a new swain to master her. There, a
short-skirted beauty, whose sways and
kicks revealed bare thighs, was dancing
wildly a solo intended to infatuate further
two rival admirers. Again, a half-crazed
sansculotte had won a girl and in token of
triumph was spinning her body horizontally
around like a top, upheld by the open
palm of his huge right arm.</p>
<p>But what might be this comic figure,
quite unpartnered&ndash;&ndash;knocked and shoved
from human pillar to human post&ndash;&ndash;winning
the deep curses of the dancers, and their
hearty wallops when not o&rsquo;er-busied with
Terpsichore?</p>
<p>Picard, the ex-valet of aristocracy, finally
let out from the Salpetriere mock-court,
had stumbled into this bedlam of sansculotte
craziness, the rhythm and procedure
of which were as foreign to him as a
proposition in Euclid.</p>
<p>But the Jolly Baker, from the Ile de
Paris, was his match. The bare-armed,
lean-legged pleasurer had equipped himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
(by way of disguise) with a large false
moustache, and evading the close watch of
his hatchet-faced, middle-aged spouse, had
come forth to celebrate. Neither dancer
nor vocalist, the Jolly Baker had other little
entertaining ways all his own.</p>
<p>As the foolscap-crowned, white-and-red-trousered
Picard bumped the pave, he saw
squatting opposite him a figure whose
gleaming eyes, ferocious whiskerage and
lean-wiry frame suggested the canine
rather than the human species. The Jolly
Baker was a bum werewolf, but a &ldquo;hot
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gleaming eyes never left Picard&rsquo;s
face, the dog-like body jumped whichever
way he did, Picard half expected the dog-man
to bite or snap the next instant and
take a chunk out of him. Both had got
to their feet now; the stranger still silent
and nosey, Picard looking out of the corner
of his eye for a way of escape. But just
then the Baker spied a maenad with a drum.</p>
<p>One could beat drum in celebration, if
naught else. Lo and behold, the posterior
of the foolscapped one would serve for a
drum very nicely! The Jolly Baker twisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Picard around, bending him half double as
he did so.</p>
<p>With a rear thrust and firm shoulder
grip, the Jolly Baker leaped upon Picard&rsquo;s
back. Emulating the young woman&rsquo;s beating
of the drum, he rained a shower of
blows on the valet&rsquo;s hind quarters.</p>
<p>The new &ldquo;drum&rdquo;-beater was now quite
the cynosure of admiring attention. He
had captured the centre of the stage. He
gloried in it. With a more elaborate, fanciful
and complexive &ldquo;rat-tat-tat-rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly lost his grip of the &ldquo;human
drum,&rdquo; Picard wriggled out from under,
and the drummer bumped his own posterior
on the pave.</p>
<p>Calmly, quite undisturbed, the foolish
Baker continued to &ldquo;rat-tat-tat&rdquo; with a
stick on the curb, then as the &ldquo;Ca Ira&rdquo; beats
resounded above him, his own squatting
body began to sway with the music in a
heightened absurdity. Picard had run off.
He was convinced these people were crazier
than any of those in the mad cells of Salpetriere....</p>

JACQUES FORGET-NOT, SWEARS VENGEANCE ON THE FAMILY OF THE DE VAUDREYS.<br />
THE COUNT DE LINIERES AND THE CHEVALIER DE VAUDREY HEAR HIS THREATS.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>Long since Henriette had evaded the
worse sights and sounds by creeping as best
she could along the side walls of the buildings,
watching her chance to get away from
the revelers. Again, at the street corner,
another swirl passed over her, knocking her
down. Ruefully she picked herself up
again.</p>
<p>The throng had passed by completely,
leaving but a drunken fool prancing here
and there, or a scant winrow of half-prostrate
figures. Henriette ran with all her
might to the only refuge she knew&ndash;&ndash;her old
faubourg lodgings.</p>
<p>The middle-aged landlady who in days
agone had fetched the guard to subdue
Danton&rsquo;s would-be assassins, and who likewise
had resented Robespierre&rsquo;s prying as
to the identity of Henriette&rsquo;s visitor, studied
the girl at first a bit quizzically. Released
from Salpetriere, eh? Was she the
same sweet, pure Henriette she knew?
Yes, the little Girard&ndash;&ndash;la petite Girard&ndash;&ndash;looked
to be the same hard-working, respectable
seamstress person of yore, only
that she seemed very weak and about to
collapse!</p>
<p>The landlady folded Henriette within one
stout arm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>She pointed with her free hand to the
bedchamber immediately above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your old room up there awaits you,&rdquo;
she remarked kindly. &ldquo;As soon as you
have recovered strength a bit, I have no
doubt the old sewing job will be yours too!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>... Jacques-Forget-Not and his
men arrived too late at the Prefect&rsquo;s palace
for complete vengeance on the de Vaudreys.</p>
<p>Around the historic Fourteenth of July,
there was a pell-mell exodus of aristocrats
from the city. A panic-stricken servant
brought the Count de Linieres tidings of
the people&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fly, monsieur! Fly, madame!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;The troops are overthrown, the Bastille
surrounded, before nightfall the mob will
surely attack here and try to kill your excellencies.
Fly, I implore you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other messengers confirmed the news,
and thus it happened that the erstwhile
proud and arrogant Minister of Police who
but yesterday had ruled France was reduced
to making the most hurried preparations
for flight, aided by the distracted Countess.</p>
<p>The latter realized with a pang that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
hegira meant farewell, perhaps forever, to
the chance of recovering her lost daughter
Louise from this welter of Paris. How
mysterious the ways of the Higher Power!
Her beloved nephew the Chevalier, at least,
was safe in the distant fortress to which
the Count her husband had condemned him.
Pray God Louise might be saved&ndash;&ndash;, yes!
and her foster-sister Henrietta, beloved of
the Chevalier&ndash;&ndash;Henriette whom her husband
had branded by unjust accusation....</p>
<p>The de Linieres party succeeded in evading
the fate of numbers of the runaway
aristocrats, who were bodily pulled out of
their coaches and trampled upon or strung
up by the infuriated mobs. They managed
to make their way to the northeastern borders
of France. There thousands of emigres
were received under the protection of
foreign powers, awaiting the ripe moment
for the impact of foreign armies on French
soil and the hoped-for reconquest of the
monarchists....</p>
<p>That night the beautiful Hotel de Vaudrey&ndash;&ndash;home
of the Vaudrey and Linieres
family and fortune&ndash;&ndash;was given up to sack
and pillage. Enraged that the objects of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
his vengeance had fled, the leader Forget-Not
ordered a general demolition.</p>
<p>Priceless works of art were hurled about
and destroyed. The cellars of old wines
were quickly emptied by drunken revelers.
The kitchen and pantries catered to the
mob&rsquo;s gluttony. Wenches arrayed themselves
in the Countess&rsquo;s costly silks and
linens; perfumed, powdered and painted
with the cosmetics; preened and perked in
the cheval mirrors.</p>
<p>Among the motley crew of destroyers,
drunkards, gluttons, satyrs and sirens, our
friend the Jolly Baker was on the job&ndash;&ndash;unfortunately
for him, accompanied this
time by his hatchet-faced spouse.</p>
<p>He started a flirtation with a new-made
vamp, all tricked out in stolen finery. The
Jolly Baker had found a new use for his
eyes and eyebrows, i.e., to convey love
messages. He was making the most alarming
motions and succeeding most prodigiously
in evoking the new vamp&rsquo;s answering
smiles when&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ker-plunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Dame Baker fetched him a tremendous
slap directly on the face that caused him to
see innumerable little stars.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>Gradually coming back to this mundane
world, the Jolly Baker resolved to devote
his strict attention to the bottle....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>KNIFE DUEL AND ESCAPE</h3>
</div>
<p>The bundle on the cellar floor of the
Frochards den stirred again, this time more
actively.</p>
<p>The crippled knife-grinder Pierre had entered.
His mother was again busied with
her potations. Under the half-lifted rags
showed the tear-stained face of Louise.
The heavy fatigue of street mendicancy had
wrapped her in deep sleep, from which she
woke with a start to her wretched surroundings.
The misery of it all overwhelmed
her. She sobbed, and the big
tears descended from her blind eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Louise!&rdquo; begged the almost
equally wretched Pierre. &ldquo;There may yet
be escape and the finding of your sister.
Oh!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If I had but the
courage to lay down my life that I might
make her happy!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The ruffian Jacques Frochard was exhibiting
a sinister interest in the blind girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
He had forbidden Pierre to speak to her
or come near her, and now as he entered,
the crippled brother shrank away. &ldquo;Get
up and go to work!&rdquo; said Mother Frochard
to the girl roughly, yanking her to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a way to make her work!&rdquo;
laughed Jacques with fiendish coarseness.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll slave for me, eh, my pretty? Yes,
for you, no one but Jacques!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leered at her as he appropriated the
coins of her singing.</p>
<p>Huddled in the corner, the silent cripple
bit his finger knuckles until they bled....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Inflamed with liquor and lust, Jacques
soon decided to carry out his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my little beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother Frochard chuckled at the sight
of him mastering her. Struggle wildly as
the poor blind creature would to avoid his
grip, he was dragging her slowly to the
stair while her screams were stifled by one
rough hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>But as he was doing this, the huddled
figure rose. &ldquo;I have been a coward long
enough,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch her!&rdquo;
laying a restraining hand on Jacques&rsquo; arm.</p>
<p>Astonished, Jacques turned. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
stop me?&rdquo; He flung his brother prostrate
half way across the room.</p>
<p>The cripple had risen again. A dirk
gleamed in his extended hand. His eyes
blazed like coals. Fury distorted his features
which were craned forward in hideous
ugliness parallel with the knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misbegotten hunchback!&rdquo; roared
Jacques, letting loose of the girl and drawing
his own knife. &ldquo;She is mine. I tell
you I will kill anyone who interferes with
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Frochard tried to throw herself between
the brothers. Louise groped away,
and as by instinct found refuge behind
Pierre. Jacques pushed the hag aside, saying
savagely: &ldquo;Let me look after this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each brother stripped off his coat, holding
it as a buckler whilst the right hand
gripped a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Jacques,&rdquo; said the frenzied
cripple. &ldquo;We Frochards come of a
race that kills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adversaries feinted around each
other in circles, in the Latin mode of fighting
that was their heritage. Coats or sidesteps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
parried or evaded blows. The knives
gleamed, but did not go quickly home.</p>
<p>If Jacques had the superior strength,
Pierre was the more cat-like. His frail body
was a slight target, so that the other&rsquo;s great
lunges missed. Then, leaping like a puma,
he was behind and under Jacques&rsquo; guard,
and stabbed him in the back.</p>
<p>The great hulk of a man fell back into La
Frochard&rsquo;s arms, the blood oozing from a
cut that was not mortal though fearsome.
The hag-mother wailed and crooned as if
he were in death agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried the hunchback to Louise,
&ldquo;the road to liberty is open.&rdquo; Taking
Louise by the hand, he ran with her up
the steps out of the cellar....</p>
<p>But Henriette did not meet&ndash;&ndash;not until
one fateful hour&ndash;&ndash;the itinerant grinder and
her loved sister whom he protected. They
were in many of the scenes of the later
Revolution. Louise ate off the de Vaudrey
plate, and Pierre perforce sharpened the
knives of the September Massacre.
Tramps of the boiling, tempestuous City,
spectators but not participants of the great
events, they looked ceaselessly for her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>Nor did the wicked Frochards abide in
the den of Louise&rsquo;s imprisonment and sufferings.
They too were swallowed up in
the vast maelstrom&ndash;&ndash;to reappear at one
ludicrous moment of tragic times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE NEW TYRANNY</h3>
</div>
<p>Before telling you how the Chevalier de
Vaudrey got out of Caen and how he fared
forth to his love, it is meet that the reader
should understand the rapidly changing
conditions that converted the New France
into a veritable Hell on earth.</p>
<p>After the Fall of the Bastille, and even
after the mob&rsquo;s sortie on Versailles which
enforced the royal family&rsquo;s return to Paris
where they lived in the Tuileries, it was the
hope of the moderate patriots that constitutional
monarchy might prevail.</p>
<p>These hopes were dashed, first, by royalty&rsquo;s
intrigues and double-dealing, and, secondly,
through the pressure of the revolting
emigres and the threat of foreign invasion
that welded all the defenders of France,
willy-nilly, into a traitor-crushing and invader-defying
Republic.</p>
<p>Of all the personages of that unhappy
time, the locksmithing King Louis XVI
least understood what was going on about
him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>A true Bourbon with an ancestry of
nearly a thousand years&rsquo; possession of the
French throne, he never learned anything
and never forgot anything. He played at
being a limited monarch but his sympathies
were naturally with the riffled aristocrats&ndash;&ndash;the
nobility whose privileges had been taken
away, their estates commandeered, their
chateaux fired or sacked, and themselves
obliged to flee for their lives to the protection
of the foreigner.</p>
<p>Not comprehending the nature of the
Storm that wiped out old tyranny, Louis
dangerously rode the Storm, he could not
guide it. His lack of understanding is
sadly shown in the closing scene at Versailles
when they brought him news of the
people&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais, c&rsquo;est une revolte. Why, that is a
revolt!&rdquo; exclaimed the bewildered monarch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sire,&rdquo; replied the Minister gravely,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis not a revolt. It is a revolution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few hours the yelling maenads
and bold satyrs of the sansculottes possessed
the gorgeous Salon de la Paix, whilst
the King and his family were on their way
to Paris....</p>
<p>Then followed many weary months of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
royalist intrigue, plot and counter plot, secret
dickers with foreign Powers, attempts
at escape, fresh indignities by the mob,
until at last Royalty is suspended from its
function, becomes the prisoner instead of
the ruler. Turned out of the Tuileries,
Louis and Marie Antoinette are no longer
King and Queen&ndash;&ndash;henceforth Citizen and
Citizeness Capet. At the end of dreadful
imprisonments, looms for the hapless pair
the dread Scaffold....</p>
<p>A real Republic teeters for a short period
on the crest of the Revolutionary wave.
Men are mad with the joy over the new
thought of universal brotherhood. Little
do Danton and the other Utopians realize
that the Pageant of Brotherhood is but the
prelude of a new Despotism.</p>
<p>For a dark ring of foes&ndash;&ndash;spurred to invasion
by the King&rsquo;s misfortunes&ndash;&ndash;surrounds
France on every side. Within, the
cry re-echoes: &ldquo;The traitors to the prisons!&rdquo;
and all the aristocrats as yet at large
are hunted down and put in durance.</p>
<p>As Minister of Justice, Danton, the idol
of the people, acts quickly to subdue aristocracy,
and ceaselessly organizes&ndash;&ndash;organizes&ndash;&ndash;organizes
the raw republican levies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
into troops fit to resist the advancing Prussians,
Austrians and Savoyards.</p>
<p>Lashed to uncontrollable rage by the preliminary
successes of the invading Prussians,
the Paris proletariat break into the
prisons and massacre the unfortunate members
of the nobility there immured. Few
are spared. Young equally with the old&ndash;&ndash;girls
and women no less than the sterner
sex&ndash;&ndash;the noble, the wise, the cultivated, the
beautiful, are murdered in cold blood. The
September Massacres shock moderates
everywhere with the feeling that France is
at last running amuck&ndash;&ndash;the mad dog of the
Nations.</p>
<p>Yes, France now is running amuck&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;ware
of her when she strikes! Lafayette
and other moderates&ndash;&ndash;indeed, several of
the Generals commanding the patriot
armies have fled over the border, disgusted
with the national rabies, utterly unable to
quench it.</p>
<p>The patriot ranks close up. The wilder
element of the sansculottes grasps the helm
of State. In the desperate need of a dictatorship
to cope against the foreign invasion,
Danton procures from the Legislature absolute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
power for a little inner group, the
Committee of Public Safety.</p>
<p>Working on the passions of the people,
worming himself into favor by denouncing
moderate suspects and advocating the extremest
measures, our sly acquaintance of
the faubourg lodgings&ndash;&ndash;Maximilien Robespierre&ndash;&ndash;becomes
the head of this Committee&ndash;&ndash;thereby
the Tyrant of France.</p>
<p>The foreign foe is indeed driven back,
but at what a cost! The rule of Robespierre&rsquo;s
fanatical minority that has seized
the State, inaugurates the dreadful Reign
of Terror. The great Revolutionary leader
Danton&ndash;&ndash;Minister of Justice in the earlier
time&ndash;&ndash;has himself caused to be established
the Revolutionary Tribunal for the quick
trial of the public&rsquo;s foes, and the guillotine
for the guilty. Robespierre uses it as a
ready forged weapon for destroying all who
do not think as he does.</p>
<p>In this storm-wracked world Jacques-Forget-Not
is now a great judge and a most
fanatical patriot. The avenger of the de
Vaudreys heads the Revolutionary Tribunal.
He is in his glory now, for the aristocrats
that the mobs overlooked are sent
in batches to the guillotine&ndash;&ndash;on the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
trifling charges, or finally without accusation
at all. The mere fact of being an aristocrat
is a capital offence!</p>
<p>And in and among these slaughters is
intermixed the destruction of Robespierre&rsquo;s
personal and political rivals&ndash;&ndash;a
work in which the vengeful Jacques-Forget-Not
studies and obeys every whim of
his master, for does not Jacques also have
private grudges as yet unpaid?</p>
<p>... But Danton remains a popular
hero. For his work in driving back the foreign
foe, he is upraised in chair of state by
the multitudes, heading a huzzaing procession
and preceded by young girls strewing
flowers.</p>
<p>None of the bloody butchery has been
Danton&rsquo;s. He has been too busy fighting
Prussia, Austria and Savoy. Today, as he
sits in the chair of state acknowledging the
acclamations, his heart wells in gratitude to
Henriette who had once saved his life&ndash;&ndash;no
face of treasured memory so dear as hers!</p>

<p>Confessedly, under the New Tyranny,
there is nothing to engage the great heart
and soul. Sick of the murderous scramble
for pelf and power, he withdraws from
most political activity, though still able to
exert a wide influence.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>About this time twenty-two political
rivals of Robespierre&ndash;&ndash;the Girondists&ndash;&ndash;were
sent by one decree to the guillotine.
Danton, vainly pleading for mercy, saw
that the Committee of Safety machine was
being made an instrument of slaughter.
&ldquo;France must be purged of all vice!&rdquo; was
Robespierre&rsquo;s sanctimonious reply to his
passionate protest. Not long after, the
rival masters of France faced one another
in the hall of the Revolutionary Tribunal,
whereof Jacques-Forget-Not was President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well works this Tribunal you established,
Danton!&rdquo; said Robespierre, in glee
at the increasing number of executions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was established,&rdquo; replied the pock-marked
man solemnly, &ldquo;to punish the
enemies of the people. Now through you&ndash;&ndash;Robespierre&ndash;&ndash;France
rivers with innocent
blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>... God help our hero and heroine if
they should encounter its dread fury!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>ADVENTURES OF A PILGRIM</h3>
</div>
<p>Some parts of France continued to be
held by the royalists after the establishment
of the Republic.</p>
<p>Insurrectionary war raged in the provinces,
particularly the stubborn war of La
Vendee, and certain loyal fortresses like
Caen managed to resist capture.</p>
<p>It was thus as a prisoner of the royalist
faction, and quite out of touch with worldshaking
events, that our young hero Chevalier
Maurice de Vaudrey lived through the
earlier period of the Revolution.</p>
<p>A love-message from him through Picard
to Henriette&ndash;&ndash;an unsuccessful attempt to
escape; a glimpse of the still handsomely
frizzed and powdered head gazing through
trefoil Gothic window on the outer sunshine
and liberty:&ndash;&ndash;such is all that we may
see of de Vaudrey&rsquo;s strangely trussed up
life during this time.</p>
<p>He was still enshrined in the heart of the
little seamstress in the Paris faubourg, still
dear to his aunt the Countess who with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
husband was an emigre beyond the borders.
Otherwise, no hermit nor solitary was more
completely effaced from the world.</p>
<p>The first light of hope was brought to
Caen by a messenger from the Countess,
who had managed to smuggle through a
letter or two and a small box of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not advise you,&rdquo; his kind Aunt
wrote. &ldquo;Escape into France would invite
your death as an aristocrat. On the other
hand, if you make use of the accompanying
pardon signed by your uncle the Count, the
Governor of Caen will probably enroll you
for the inhuman and useless war of La
Vendee. Take the money, my dear
Nephew, and use it as you deem best&ndash;&ndash;the
messenger will secure it for you outside the
prison until you need it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Vaudrey pondered, as his Aunt advised.
But, really, there was but the one
course for him! To win through, disguised,
at whatever peril, to Henriette; to
find her and Louise; to save them from that
black welter of the Revolution, and guide
them out of the country to the loving care
of the Countess and the repentant Count:
yes, such was the course that both Love
and Duty dictated. He would begin it that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
night, aided by his faithful friend the messenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand part of the gold,&rdquo; he whispered
the Countess&rsquo;s agent, &ldquo;to some rustic carter
on whom you can rely. Bring another part
here and give it to a keeper whom I shall
point out to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impromptu little plot worked perfectly.
The friendly keeper, having gotten
a peep at the ex-Police Prefect&rsquo;s letter of
pardon, needed but the clincher argument
of the gold in order to aid de Vaudrey&rsquo;s escape.
A rope over the wall, and even a
plank across the moat, were mysteriously
provided. In the last silent watch of the
night, the go-between (who had been waiting)
conducted the escaped prisoner to the
carter&rsquo;s cavern. Already the East was
showing the ghostly light of the first faint
streaks of dawn.</p>
<p>Having breakfasted in the cave and put
his few belongings into a pack, de Vaudrey
with the two others stepped out of the dark
hole into the growing light.</p>
<p>The carter pointed to the Chevalier&rsquo;s
frizzled locks and elegant if faded dress.
&ldquo;They would take you up at the first village
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
crossing on that!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Your
get-up gives you away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chevalier retired to a new toilette.
Within, were the primitive resources of
rustic wardrobe. As he emerged again from
the cavern, old boon companions would indeed
have been startled by the guise he
now wore.</p>
<p>Beautiful apparel, cane, wig, lorgnette
and snuffbox were in the discard. The frizzled
locks were gone, revealing long
straight black hair which was crowned by a
shabby tricorne hat. The Chevalier&rsquo;s elegant
form was covered by an ill-fitting
ragged black suit, which a pair of dusty
shoes well matched. Across one shoulder
he carried a pack stick, to which a thoroughly
disreputable-looking small black
bundle was fastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do now,&rdquo; said the rustic. &ldquo;Remember
you&rsquo;re only a helper on a carter&rsquo;s
journey to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rustic and helper took their leave of the
go-between by plunging through a wide
but shallow stream. When they had
emerged at the farther bank, they felt secure
that their steps could not be traced.
Waving good-byes to the other, the rustic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
and his man hastened to a stable where they
loaded a provision wagon and attached a
country Dobbin to the thills. Presently de
Vaudrey, in his new character of the carter&rsquo;s
assistant, was on the first stage of
the long journey to the storm-wracked
metropolis.</p>
<p>The carter&rsquo;s load was of so little value,
the whole outfit so poverty-stricken, that
neither country Royalist nor provincial
Revolutionary saw fit to bother them.</p>
<p>Gradually the carter sold his wares in the
smaller villages en route. They wisely
avoided the larger towns. The cart was
nearly empty now. Saleables had all been
disposed of except a few apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you and I going to get into
Paris?&rdquo; said the distinguished young aristocrat,
whose respect for the Reuben had
increased daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me!&rdquo; said the other. His broad,
moon-faced physiognomy masked the
cunning of the fox. &ldquo;I have this apple
here&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carter eyed his assistant intently and
winked solemnly as if to say: &ldquo;That will do
the trick!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>As they leave the open country behind
and jog through the better settled regions
immediately north of Paris, let us take our
stand beside the &ldquo;barrier&rdquo; or outer gate
which they are slowly approaching.</p>
<p>Judge Forget-Not and his fellows are inspecting
the barriers. The voice of the
Chief is heard speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch strictly that no aristocrats escape.
Our new <i>law</i> also condemns to death
all who harbor an aristocrat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inquisitor&rsquo;s face assumes a yet
harsher expression as he addresses the
guards: &ldquo;Beware lest you yourselves be
suspect!&ndash;&ndash;Remember the sharp female
&lsquo;Guillotine&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forget-Not draws a significant hand
across the throat. A shudder passes
through the more timid folk.</p>
<p>The coarse-faced guards applaud and
promise to use the utmost precautions. The
judges move on, inspecting another part of
the barrier.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>ADVENTURES OF A PILGRIM (CONTINUED)</h3>
</div>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s cart nears the gate. The
moon-faced Reuben is as impassive as ever.
Though the tall assistant manages to keep
his expression fairly immobile too, &rsquo;tis evident
to us who know him that he labors
under suppressed excitement. For the prize
of his Great Quest is Henriette; the penalty
of discovery and capture, Death!</p>
<p>The gallant young man does not hesitate,
however. He has never shrunk from Danger&rsquo;s
bright face, least of all would he
shrink now when the passing of a brief ordeal
may well mean reunion with his beloved
and her rescue from the welter of
Paris. The Pilgrim&rsquo;s soul hungers and
thirsts for her. After the great Sahara of
imprisoned loneliness, how near the Oasis
of love and rapture! How beautiful the
prospect, if not indeed Mirage!</p>
<p>The rustic&rsquo;s helper dismounts with the
farmer at the gate, and follows him into the
office of the registrar. The farmer presents
a pass.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is for one only,&rdquo; says the registrar
at the gate, roughly. &ldquo;The other cannot go
through,&rdquo; he says, pointing to de Vaudrey,
who tries to look as stupid and uncomprehending
as possible.</p>
<p>The farmer hands a big red apple to the
functionary. But the latter makes a gesture
of refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bite into it!&rdquo; says the Rustic ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>The official bites at the top which comes
off&ndash;&ndash;a smooth and even slice. The centre
of the apple is hollow. Within it are several
gold coins.</p>
<p>Quickly the gatekeeper covers the golden
apple with his hairy paw. &ldquo;Your papers
are all right,&rdquo; he says gruffly, rapidly converting
the figure 1 into a 2, and viseing the
pass for two. He motions for both the man
and the youth to go through.</p>
<p>The farmer and his follower drive in and
mix with the crowd on the inside of the barrier.
At this stage the farmer disappears
from our history. But the face of the youth
is noted by an eagle eye and recognized by
a brain that does not forget!</p>
<p>The prowling Judge sees the Chevalier,
though the Chevalier does not see him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Follow that man!&rdquo; he says quietly to
his deputies. &ldquo;We shall catch him red-handed
in some plot!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Our little heroine had lived quietly for
many months in the faubourg lodgings to
which, perforce, she had to return after her
vain visit to the Frochard cellar and her
rough handling by the Carmognole rioters.
The little sparrow of a seamstress was quite
undisturbed by the great events of the
French Revolution, except as they had put
everything at sixes and sevens and whirled
away her own intimates in the mad whirligig.</p>
<p>The pock-marked man (whom she had
sheltered overnight in this very place) was
the Savior of the Country; the prying
lodger Robespierre was the Chief of State.
Of course she never saw them now, her
small self would hardly dare address them!
Sister Genevieve and the Doctor, who had
told her about the Frochards&rsquo; den, were no
longer within her ken.</p>
<p>The weary months had dragged along.
Notwithstanding the cheering message
conveyed by Picard, her knight the Chevalier&ndash;&ndash;so
far as she knew&ndash;&ndash;was still a prisoner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
of Caen. And the weary months had
dragged their ball and chain of silence and
despair still more wearingly in the failure
of her many renewed attempts to find
Louise. The blind sister was again swallowed
up in the devouring city&ndash;&ndash;the Frochards
were fled.</p>
<p>Whither was Henriette to look&ndash;&ndash;whither
to turn?</p>
<p>A ray of light from the window glinted
on the holy Book of books that the girl
treasured. She opened it. A line read at
random comforted her. Clasping the volume
in her hands, she knelt in prayer, addressing
God softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou who hast said: &lsquo;I am the Light!&rsquo;
oh, show me the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of a knock at the door, the
girl rose from her supplications. Entered
sad and dusty pilgrim, carrying his few belongings
in bag suspended from shoulder
stick. Now they dropped sharply to the
floor, and the disguised Chevalier gazed
long and earnestly upon his love.</p>
<p>Her eyes in turn were riveted on his sad,
lean apparition, how terribly changed from
the old debonair days! Kind sympathy
spoke in her look and mien till the radiance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of love, beginning in little ghosts of welcoming
smiles at the corners of her mouth,
broke into clear effulgence.</p>
<p>The Chevalier tottered forward. He collapsed
into the nearest chair.</p>
<p>She put her arms around him and hovered
there, comforting him with affectionate
little hand pats and soft kisses.</p>
<p>Jacques-Forget-Not, the avenger of the
de Vaudreys, had not been far behind during
the pilgrim&rsquo;s tramp across the city. He
had in fact sneaked back of him, seen the
wanderer enter Henriette&rsquo;s door. Standing
at the head of the stair, he could almost
overhear stray phrases of their talk, knew
that they were quite within his power.</p>
<p>The shaggy-haired one fairly gloated in
his triumph. &ldquo;Number One!&rdquo; he hissed,
raising a forefinger in token that de Vaudrey&ndash;&ndash;the
first of his Trinity of Hate&ndash;&ndash;was
in the net. &ldquo;Two and Three shall come
next!&rdquo; he whispered savagely, knuckling
down two other fingers to mark his vengeance
on the Count and Countess.</p>
<p>The shaggy-haired Forget-Not hurried
down the stairs, his gaunt features baleful
with unholy glee. Pointing significantly
overhead, he ordered a detail of his guards:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest de Vaudrey and all in that
room!&rdquo; The men at once proceeded to
carry out the order.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The guard captain would have been
equally at home in a pirate crew or at a land
massacre. Enormous black brows and
heavy moustache accentuated his ferocity,
the particolored Revolutionary garb and in
particular the red-and-white striped pantaloons
gave him a bizarre appearance like a
pirate chief.</p>
<p>The detail were armed with muskets and
bayonets. They clattered up the stairs and
burst into Henriette&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>The lovers seemed dazed rather than affrighted.
They clasped each other again.
With a little warning gesture Henriette
bade Maurice say nothing when the captain
addressed him as de Vaudrey.</p>
<p>The villain laid a heavy hand on his victim
while two of the soldiers seized and
pinioned his arms. &ldquo;You are under arrest
as a returned emigre!&rdquo; the head pirate said.</p>
<p>Then he turned his attention to Henriette
who made futile little efforts like a tiny
mother wren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are also under arrest, Citizeness,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
said the captain harshly, &ldquo;for the crime of
sheltering a returned aristocrat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot be blamed,&rdquo; interrupted de
Vaudrey. &ldquo;I entered this place, uninvited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; roared the Captain. &ldquo;Your
plea, if any, must be made to the Revolutionary
Tribunal.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>BEFORE THE DREAD TRIBUNAL</h3>
</div>
<p>That awful Tribunal sat daily. During
the height of the Terror, no time was allowed
to prisoners for the preparation of
their cases&ndash;&ndash;no interval elapsed between
the prisoners&rsquo; arrest and their arraignment.
Dispatch&ndash;&ndash;<i>dispatch</i>&ndash;&ndash;DISPATCH was the
essence of the bloody business, the purpose
being to strike terror upon all that opposed
the little fanatical minority then in power.</p>
<p>Therefore the guard brought Henriette
and Maurice directly from their arrest to
their trial, and they gazed upon a sight for
Gods and men&ndash;&ndash;a travesty on the sacred
name of justice. Such scenes would seem
unbelievable to us but for the recent events
of the Russian Revolution, which prove
that in our age also a proletarian dictatorship
can be senselessly wicked and cruel.</p>
<p>The trials&ndash;&ndash;beside their Terror function
of upholding a minority government&ndash;&ndash;were
great public shows for the howling rabble
and leering sansculottes, the hoodlums of
Paris whom even the masters dared not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
offend. The riff-raff acted exactly as at any
of their own celebrations and feastings.</p>
<p>Along the side benches and up on the
&ldquo;Mountain,&rdquo; flirtation and sweethearting
went on, of a rough-and-ready order. Some
spectators coolly munched their dinners.
Others, having brought along their bottles,
indulged in drinking bouts. Everyone&rsquo;s
ideas of a good time cannot be the same.
There was our eccentric acquaintance the
Jolly Baker, for instance. The height of
bliss for him, at one of these capital trials,
was to lean far, far back with open mouth
whilst a tilted bottle, held by a ministering
Hebe, spilled ecstatic drops of damp and
ruby &ldquo;happiness&rdquo; upon his &ldquo;open-face&rdquo;
physiognomy.</p>
<p>Another misfit of the grotesque crowds
was Picard, foolishly trying to discover
what &rsquo;twas all about, gazing soulful-eyed
into hoodlum &ldquo;mugs&rdquo; that gave him the
merry &ldquo;ha! ha!&rdquo; or sickened him with the
likeness of the First Murderer. But
&ldquo;crime,&rdquo; in one instance at least, was followed
by &ldquo;punishment,&rdquo; for as the murderous
citizen suddenly thrust out his roaring
raucous mouth, Picard inadvertently leaned
back.</p>

LOUISE AND LA FROCHARD TRYING TO KEEP PIERRE,<br />
THE CRIPPLE, FROM FIGHTING HIS BROTHER JACQUES.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>The huge sansculotte, to his own surprise,
was eating the bushy horse-hair pigtail
of Picard&rsquo;s bobbing queue! The ex-valet
made a quick duck. His murderous-looking
neighbor, with a full swing, walloped
the countenance of the sansculotte
beyond....</p>
<p>On this day of our characters&rsquo; trial, the
side benches and balconies of the great hall
quickly fill with the howling, leering mobs&ndash;&ndash;the
fierce and grotesque chorus of the
grim tragedy.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the rabid Jacobins are
other&ndash;&ndash;less partisan&ndash;&ndash;spectators, and
among the hurrying throngs a close observer
might have noticed the luckless
Pierre Frochard and the blind girl Louise
entering. They found seats on a front
bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judges are taking their places now,&rdquo;
said Pierre. &ldquo;You will soon hear the trials.
Over on their right sits Robespierre, the
dictator of France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judges, so-called, are five villainous
individuals, wearing dirty-looking plumed
hats, black jerkins and breeches, and tall
jack boots. The shaggy-haired Jacques-Forget-Not
presides.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>A frowsy public prosecutor&ndash;&ndash;red, white
and blue cockade affixed to his tousled hat
plume&ndash;&ndash;calls the names of the accused and
presents the charge. From the background,
the stripe-panted soldiery are bringing
the victims up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are arraigning them in batches,&rdquo;
says Pierre. &ldquo;The judges make quick
work!&rdquo; Louise shudders, lays hold of his
arm.</p>
<p>There is something horrible in the sound
of the advancing footsteps; the harsh accusations
and weak replies, oft drowned by
the sansculottes&rsquo; roar; the sentences of
doom, and the final scuffling of feet as the
soldiers seize their prey and bear it off.</p>
<p>Innocence and guilt often go up together.</p>
<p>Unfortunate women of the street are arraigned
next high-bred aristocrats, or
moderates whose only crime has been to
denounce such horrors. A gallant gentleman
pleads vainly to the judges who are
also the jury: &ldquo;We have had no trial!&rdquo;
The mob howls &ldquo;Guillotine!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guillotine!&rdquo;
is Jacques-Forget-Not&rsquo;s brief sentence !</p>
<p>A young Corsican lieutenant of artillery
looks on meditatively. His silent thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
is sensed by a bystander who remarks: &ldquo;I
suppose, Napoleon, you think you could
manage things better!&rdquo; The man grins.
But Napoleon Bonaparte&ndash;&ndash;he who snuffed
out Revolution later by whiff of grapeshot&ndash;&ndash;nods
gravely yes.</p>
<p>As the prisoners from the faubourg are
brought in, Henriette sees the loved and
long lost face of her dreams among the
front row of the sansculottes.</p>
<p>Stupefied, unbelieving, she looks again
and again. Yes, it is she&ndash;&ndash;none other! Her
own peril and that of Maurice are unthought
of. Protective love of the blind
one tides back in resistless strength.</p>
<p>She is trying now to escape from the
guards, run to her sister&ndash;&ndash;even to pantomime
her love, gesticulate it with funny
little motions and confidential fingers on
lips&ndash;&ndash;forgetting that the other cannot see!
And then her wild, excited cry rings
through the great hall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;LOUISE! LOUISE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise jumps to her feet, groping wildly
towards the cry. Her blind features are
strained in agonized expectancy. Pierre
has located the frenzied Henriette. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
guides the groping blind girl from the
benches to her sister.</p>
<p>In this council chamber of hates and
cruelty, rulers and attendants alike are
steeled against shrieks of suffering or the
outbursts of the accused. A fence of locked
bayonets stops each advancing sister. Paying
rather less heed to the incident than if
it were a request for a drink of water, the
soldiery push back Pierre and Louise to the
seats and make ready to obey the prosecutor&rsquo;s
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizen de Vaudrey and Henriette Girard
to the bar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chevalier faces the dread quintet.
The prosecutor reads the charge, demands
the death penalty on the returned aristocrat.
Poor Henriette is divided between
her frenzied wish to clasp her sister and
her horror about Maurice.</p>
<p>The young man defends himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An emigre, yes!&rdquo; he acknowledges, &ldquo;but
not an enemy of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many a spectator of the scenes&ndash;&ndash;even the
wicked judges&ndash;&ndash;could bear witness (did not
prejudice blind!) to his kindness for the afflicted
and fallen. Is there an undercurrent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
of sympathy for him even amongst hard
sansculottes?</p>
<p>But this is Jacques-Forget-Not&rsquo;s great
moment.</p>
<p>Vengeance&rsquo;s hour has struck.</p>
<p>The wickedness of the old de Vaudreys
is to be expiated at last!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>VENGEANCE COME TO JUDGMENT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I myself accuse you, Citizen de Vaudrey!&rdquo;
says the Judge, rising and pointing
to the culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accuse your family and all aristocrats
of oppression and murder through countless
generations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A yell of approval&ndash;&ndash;the savage howl of
the Mob Beast&ndash;&ndash;resounds from the rabble
whose passion is played upon. It is followed
by the general roar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guillotine! <i>Guillotine!</i> GUILLOTINE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile Forget-Not records the
death sentence given by his compliant fellow
judges, in his book. Chevalier de Vaudrey
is hustled back to the rear of the hall.</p>
<p>Poor trembling Henriette is next. The
horrors of Maurice&rsquo;s condemnation and the
thought of her little lost sister nearby, rack
her with a stinging pain in which is commingled
little thought of self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sheltered this aristocrat?&rdquo; questions
the Judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;love him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The penalty for sheltering an emigre is
death!&rdquo; replies Forget-Not shrilly, again
playing to the Jacobins.</p>
<p>But Henriette is thinking of the suffering
Louise. She strives to direct the Judge&rsquo;s
attention to the blind girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might hear!&rdquo; says Henriette softly.
&ldquo;Please&ndash;&ndash;not so loud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judge turns the pages of his book
in studied indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&ndash;&ndash;my sister&ndash;&ndash;we have just met
after a long time&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;she is blind!&rdquo; The
little voice breaks off in sobs.</p>
<p>The idea strikes her that, if they can
only see the helpless creature, they will
have pity. She calls:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise, stand up&ndash;&ndash;they want to see
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cripple Pierre aids Louise to her feet.
She stands there alone, a picture of abject
misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; cries Henriette. &ldquo;Blind&ndash;&ndash;no
one to care for her!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The dandified dictator of France fixes
fishy eyes on the little person in the dock.
One affected hand has raised a double lorgnette
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
through which he peers at her. He
muses, strokes a long nostril with his forefinger,
recollects something which causes
him to curl his lip:</p>
<p>Henriette&rsquo;s door slam on the obscure
Maximilian Robespierre finds its re-echo
to day at the gates of Death. Ah, yes, he
has placed the girl of the Faubourg lodging
now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were an inmate of the prison for
fallen women?&rdquo; he asks coldly.</p>
<p>The clear, unashamed blue eyes would
have told innocence if the words had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, but I was not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robespierre&rsquo;s delicate hand passes in the
faintest movement across his throat and
toys with the neck ruffle underneath it.</p>
<p>His lips frame a dreadful word though he
does not speak it. A nod to Jacques-Forget-Not
completes the by-play.</p>
<p>The servant imitates the master&rsquo;s gesture.
This time, the drawing of the hand
across the throat is more decisive.</p>
<p>Jacques speaks the word that his master
did not vocalize. The other judges confirm
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GUILLOTINE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henriette is borne shrieking out to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
death chamber&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;One hour with her&ndash;&ndash;only
one hour&ndash;&ndash;then I will go with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she and the Vaudrey are already
being taken out together by the attendants.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXV_THE_VOICE_OF_DANTON' id='CHAPTER_XXV_THE_VOICE_OF_DANTON'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE VOICE OF DANTON</h3>
</div>
<p>We have explained that Danton took little
part in the Government after the repelling
of the foreign foe and the commencement
of the Terror. He had no sympathy
with the excesses of his former colleagues,
but on the other hand was subject to
strange lassitudes or inhibitions that oft
paralyzed his spirit except at the supreme
hour.</p>
<p>Saving France had been his real job.</p>
<p>Among these petty and mean minds seeking
power or pelf or the repayment of some
ancient grudge, Danton had nothing to do!
He loved his frontier fighters&ndash;&ndash;men who,
the same as himself, dared all for France.</p>
<p>They were somewhat like our cowboys
of the Western plains. Born to the saddle;
recruited for the northern cavalry; supremely
successful in whirlwind charges
and harassing flank attacks that drove back
Brunswick&rsquo;s legions, they were now quartered
on well-deserved furlough within the
city.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>The old lion of Danton&rsquo;s nature woke
again, his indomitable spirit reasserted
itself whenever he went to their yard and
roused them by his patriotic eloquence.</p>
<p>Alas! within the tribunal and on the execution
place at the other side of the city,
was that going on which shamed patriotism
and mocked liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Guillotine&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;that fiendish beheading
instrument that a deputy named Doctor
Guillotin had devised&ndash;&ndash;was become Robespierre&rsquo;s
private engine to tyrannize France.</p>
<p>It stood in a great suburban place, on a
scaffolding led up to by a flight of steps:
a tall massive upright with high cross piece&ndash;&ndash;uglier
than the gallows. A brightly
gleaming, triangular knife, about the size
of a ploughshare, worked up and down in
the channels.</p>
<p>The knife was first raised to the top of the
upright, and held there by a lever. The
master of the ceremonial raised right hand
in token to the executioners to be ready.</p>
<p>As he dropped his hand in a down-sweeping
gesture, one of these villains pulled the
rope which released the lever. Down fell
the heavy knife across the neck opening of
a body board to which the victim was strapped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Below the contraption was a huge
basket.</p>
<p>A cordon of soldiery guarded the place,
keeping back the crowds. The brawny executioners&ndash;&ndash;naked
to the waist, like butchers
in a stockyard&ndash;&ndash;daily performed their
office.</p>
<p>On this day of Henriette and Maurice&rsquo;s
sentence, they were giving it a preliminary
trial. &ldquo;The trigger&rsquo;s been slipping&ndash;&ndash;not
working well,&rdquo; the head fellow explained
to the master of ceremonies. Back and forth
the terrible guillotine knife hissed and
whistled until they pronounced its action
perfect....</p>
<p>Danton and three of his friends had an
errand at the Government that day that
took them past the death chamber. A little
frightened face amongst the condemned
drew his notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing aristocrats, yes!&rdquo; he was thinking.
&ldquo;But these poor huddled folk are not
the public foe. Would I might summon the
legions to put an end to slaughter&ndash;&ndash;but that
Robespierre has inflamed all France with
the lust of blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was startled from the reflection by
the woe-begone, distrait little thing who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
seemed hypnotized by terror. The tall man
bent down and peered at the girl.</p>
<p>Like the other condemned, her hands had
just been pinioned behind her. She stood
forlorn and helpless.</p>
<p>Horror froze him.... The Child who had
saved his life from the spadassins&ndash;&ndash;the dear
little face the memory of which he had always
treasured! He asked her a mute question,
she mutely nodded.</p>
<p>So black-hearted murder was to snuff her
out too&ndash;&ndash;yes, and that young man nearby,
Maurice de Vaudrey whom he knew.</p>
<p>Not if Danton could protect and save!</p>
<p>Stern was his voice as he said to the
jailer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some mistake. Keep her&ndash;&ndash;and
her friend&ndash;&ndash;until I return!&rdquo; He was on his
heel and striding to the courtroom.</p>
<p>A follower sensed his purpose. He laid
hand on Danton&rsquo;s shoulder, saying: &ldquo;No,
Danton&ndash;&ndash;you endanger your own life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I do? She must be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we see him pass into the Tribunal,
let us stop for a moment and watch the procedure
in the death chamber. Outside,
the tumbrils of death clatter up to receive
their load. A functionary calls the names
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
of the condemned whilst a court officer
identifies them. Each in turn is bundled
off to the carts. The men hesitate over
Henriette and Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ex-Minister of Justice,&rdquo; said one,
&ldquo;asked that this case be delayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is here,&rdquo; said the master functionary,
a creature of the Dictator. &ldquo;She
goes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well take the other too,&rdquo;
said the court officer, pointing to de Vaudrey....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Superbly the Lion of the Revolution
faced the judges and the mob, and demanded
a hearing. Robespierre uplifted
eyebrows and half-smiled, vulpinely. His
rapid exchange of looks with the Court
seemed to say: &ldquo;Well, we have got to listen
to this crazy man, but be on guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president, Jacques-Forget-Not, took
the cue and acceded to Danton&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great injustice has been done,&rdquo; cried
Danton, &ldquo;to the innocent and helpless. I ask
the lives of Henriette Girard and Citizen
de Vaudrey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judges did not need to answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>A savage cry of &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; swelled from
the infuriated &ldquo;Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sansculottes half rose from their
benches, shaking minatory fists, yelling,
gesticulating. Faces were contorted in
fury. The mob&ndash;&ndash;the same that had once
acclaimed Danton in chair of state&ndash;&ndash;was not
to be balked of blood.</p>
<p>The orator continued: &ldquo;These sufferers
are friends of you who demand their death.
The girl once saved <i>me</i>&ndash;&ndash;the organizer of
your victory&ndash;&ndash;from spadassins. The boy
was ever known as the people&rsquo;s benefactor&ndash;&ndash;I
have seen him buy loaves to keep you
from starving! Now through trumped-up
charges they are to be hurried away to
death&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You question the justice of the people&rsquo;s
Tribunal?&rdquo; interrupted Judge Forget-Not
shrilly, with obvious play at the mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s bells!&rdquo; replied the indignant Thunderer.
&ldquo;I established this Tribunal. Did
not I as Minister of Justice set it in being,
and shall I not speak when crimes are done
in its name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>... In the death chamber Henriette and
Maurice were trying to kiss each other
good-by. The guards had separated them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
Vaudrey was going in one death cart, Henriette
in another....</p>
<p>He had silenced the querulous Forget-Not,
was waking the echoes with the same
thunders that had nerved France to resist
the foe. &ldquo;I ask for their lives not only, but
for MERCY and JUSTICE to wipe out the
tyranny and cruelty that are befouling all
of us. I ask for a regenerated nation, purged
of these vile offences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robespierre was sinisterly serious now.</p>
<p>The group of judges sat amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give Danton a hearing!&rdquo; was the murmur
among the sansculottes, half awed by
his old witchery.</p>
<p>The impassioned orator swung upon
them, his old supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart&ndash;&ndash;my brain&ndash;&ndash;my soul&ndash;&ndash;my
very life! Do they mean anything to you&ndash;&ndash;to
France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YES! YES!&rdquo; shouted the answering
mob, caught by the personal appeal.</p>
<p>Alarmed at the swiftly changing tide,
the Chief Judge sought the Dictator&rsquo;s eye.
The orator&rsquo;s eyes were far away, his frame
was convulsed by emotion as he cried: &ldquo;My
very life&ndash;&ndash;everything&ndash;&ndash;I owe to one of
these victims!&rdquo; The mob identified its
cause with Danton&rsquo;s, submerged their personalities
with his own!</p>

<p>Robespierre answered Forget-Not&rsquo;s look.
He indicated the speaker by a slight motion
of the head, then drew his right hand across
the throat, played with the lace ruffles&ndash;&ndash;and
smiled! Forget-Not understood. Not
then&ndash;&ndash;but later, only a little later&ndash;&ndash;would
come the time to snuff out this disturber!</p>
<p>Danton turned from the mob, swinging
the peroration to the judges in the one impassioned
cry of &ldquo;JUSTICE!&rdquo; Lion-like he
glanced from those mean, denying souls
to the rabble, and held out his hands.</p>
<p>Like an avalanche, the &ldquo;Mountain&rdquo; swept
down from benches to hall and on, on toward
the judges. Murder was in their eyes.
A word from the Thunderer would have
sealed Forget-Not&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wish! Give Danton his wish!&rdquo; they
roared.</p>
<p>Like a monkey the man Forget-Not
leaped and cowered behind his bar, imploring
Robespierre for a sign. The Dictator
nodded to yield. But again was there not
the very slightest motion of hand past neck,
the eyes side-glancing at the Thunderer?</p>
<p>Danton stilled the tempest as Chief Judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Forget-Not wrote the reprieve and the
other affrighted Judges confirmed it.</p>
<p>... Outside, the tumbrils were already
on their way to the guillotine. Henrietta
and de Vaudrey were approaching the
gates of death....</p>

<h3>REPRIEVE OR AGONY</h3>
</div>
<p>The man Forget-not, directly the paper
was signed, rushed past the speaker and
out of the hall into the lobbies. He was
followed presently by the Court&rsquo;s messenger.
There was here some trickery or
other that Danton sensed.</p>
<p>He could not stop the Chief Judge leaving,
but he pounced on the messenger and
yanked the reprieve out of his hand. &ldquo;I
will deliver it!&rdquo; said Danton. The people
applauded the act. Everyone knew that
he dared greatly.</p>
<p>Quick as he had been, Jacques-Forget-Not
had already given his orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop Danton if you can!&rdquo; had been
Jacques&rsquo; word to the outer guard. To his
inspectors of defences, he had said: &ldquo;The
barriers to the guillotine&ndash;&ndash;close them!&rdquo;
He ran forth to see that the orders were
obeyed. None of Robespierre&rsquo;s party
wanted to see Danton achieve his errand
of mercy&ndash;&ndash;least of all, the vengeful Jacques-Forget-Not!....</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>The pock-marked Thunderer wasn&rsquo;t
stopped beyond the door. His giant
strength threw off the minions who would
have blocked him. He hastened to the
yard where his beloved troopers were
quartered.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Henriette and Maurice&rsquo;s route lay past
an obscene and sacrilegious rite.</p>
<p>Mocking at religion, the more fanatical
had thrown off every vestige of decency
and indulged in Bacchanalian worship of
a so-called &ldquo;Goddess of Reason.&rdquo; This
was a lewd female from the Paris half-world,
flower-chapleted, flimsily draped,
prancing in drunken frenzy atop a table
surrounded by her &ldquo;worshippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Feast of Reason included hundreds
of revelers grouped around the open-air
tables for the &ldquo;supper of Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity,&rdquo; and between long lines
of these they were obliged to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink a toast to the Goddess!&rdquo; cried
the revelers, offering the winecup to the
victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curses on them!&rdquo; said others. &ldquo;Death
is too good for vile aristocrats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tra-la-la-la!&rdquo; sang drunken wenches,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
&ldquo;La Guillotine will soon hold ye in her
sharp embrace&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blasphemy of burlesquing a far
greater Scene of Sorrows occurred to
drunken Carmagnole dancers. The notion
was applauded, carried into effect at once.</p>
<p>A tall sansculotte reached over betwixt
the guards and placed a Crown of Thorns
on the girl&rsquo;s brow. Another dashed a cupful
of vinegar in the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see she&rsquo;s helpless?&rdquo; said a
centurion, pointing to her pinioned arms.
He yanked off the chaplet and threw it
back in the crowd. They roared with
merriment at the farce....</p>
<p>But, in the stable yard of the Northern
cavalry, Danton from a horseblock was
addressing the fiery spirits who knew and
loved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you dare with Danton?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Will you risk Death to open a Nation&rsquo;s
eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head Cavalryman embraced the
Thunderer and kissed him on both cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are with you to the last man&ndash;&ndash;to
the last ounce of our strength to save this
girl and boy!&rdquo; he said while the others
cheered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>Danton had got a gallant white mount,
the Captain was on a noble black Arabian
charger; the others had leaped astride their
ever ready army steeds&ndash;&ndash;the ride with the
reprieve was in full course!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE FAREWELL</h3>
</div>
<p>Louise, guided by her faithful attendant
Pierre, had left the courtroom directly
after the condemnation. Leaning heavily
upon him, the blind girl had staggered out,
or pressed by the awful knowledge that her
sister Henriette was doomed to die. &ldquo;Oh,
take me to her!&rdquo; she had cried.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do: to follow
the route of the death tumbrils, in the
slight hope of overtaking her. The crippled
Pierre could not walk fast, and the steps
of Louise had to be most carefully directed.
Now and again Pierre could see the death
carts a long way ahead, he tried to hasten
their steps, but presently the transports
of death were out of sight again.</p>
<p>A traffic tie-up and street delay that
halted the tumbrils just beyond the scene
of the bacchanalian Feast of Reason, gave
them their opportunity. Here the revelers
had burlesqued Henriette as the &ldquo;Woman
of Sorrows,&rdquo; and here the guardsman had
thrown off the chaplet and rebuked the
crowd.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>During the halt Pierre and his companion
came up with what speed they could; he
led Louise to the back of the death cart,
and placed her hands on the bound and
standing figure of poor little Henriette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your sister!&rdquo; said Pierre softly.</p>
<p>Gently the blind girl&rsquo;s fingers traveled
up to the wet face of her little foster-mother,
now bending towards her. With
a handkerchief Louise tenderly wiped it,
her fingers gave loving little pats of the
heaving neck and bosom, she kissed the
stained cheeks, and then the girls&rsquo; lips met&ndash;&ndash;met
long and passionately! No words
were spoken, none was needed for a reunion
that was also a farewell.</p>
<p>The cart moved. The loving lips were
parted. Now one might see Louise&rsquo;s imploring
arms still held out toward the sad
receding little figure.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was indeed a busy day for the executioners.
Batches of men and women preceded
Henriette and Maurice. Two of
these were beautiful young girls who, in
default of priest, were saying the last offices
of the Church as they knelt on the
bare ground. In tragic glory Faith&rsquo;s clear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
credo rang out: &ldquo;<i>I am the Resurrection and
the Life; he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their lovely heads dropped in the basket
as the knitting women clicked their needles
and cried &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; Henriette, with a physical
retch at the sight, fell back half-fainting
on Maurice. Roughly the soldiers
yanked them asunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citizeness, your time is come!&rdquo; said
one of the brawny butchers. He half led,
half supported her up the steps of the
guillotine....</p>
<p>The Chief executioner turned Henriette
about, inspecting her fine points as an
equine connoisseur would inspect a filly.
He gloated over her not yet budded form,
the swan-like neck, unlined piquant features,
the golden head-curls that fell in
ringlets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty one&ndash;&ndash;eh, Jean?&rdquo; he commented
to his assistant.</p>
<p>Between the two, they had strapped her
unresisting on the board. They lowered
it below the razor edge of the knife, so
that she lay prone with her neck directly
underneath. The finale was to fasten on
the neck piece, a round-holed cross board
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
which prevented the head from drawing
back....</p>
<p>Alas! what avails it that five miles away&ndash;&ndash;in
the heart of the city&ndash;&ndash;the hoofbeats of
a company of cavalry resound rhythmically
over the flagstones?</p>
<p>Danton and his Northern riders are
straining every nerve, galloping their steeds
furiously&ndash;&ndash;eyes fixed on the seeming-impossible
goal. Rather are they modern
centaurs, each rider and steed a unit of
undivisible will and energy: Danton a
furious resistless hippogriff, fire-striking,
fire-exhaling, in unity with his white
charger; the lean-jawed, sternly set Captain
on his lean galloping Arabian, cyclonic,
onrushing like some Spectral Horseman;
the rest riding like the Valkyries&ndash;&ndash;as it
were, twixt Heaven and earth&ndash;&ndash;their galloping
beats scorning the ground as they
rush by to the hissing of the cleaved and
angry winds.</p>
<p>But what avails it?...</p>
<p>Even on the straightway &rsquo;twere a quarter-hour
ride to the outer-suburban locality
where the guillotine does its dreadful
work. Ancient Paris with its tortuous
streets delays them. Ahead, are Jacques-Forget-Not&ndash;&ndash;Jacobin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
troops&ndash;&ndash;barriers&ndash;&ndash;gates.</p>
<p>Poor little Henriette&rsquo;s golden head!</p>
<p>Is it not fated to drop in the basket long,
long before they can appear?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>MANIAC WITH A DAGGER</h3>
</div>
<p>A sansculotte soldier, less brutal than
his fellows, had allowed Louise and Pierre
to approach one side of the scaffold. They
were more privileged than the frantic
Picard, who could not get near his young
master and mistress. Revolutionary infantry
guarded every side of the public
square. Intermingled among them were
the favored hoodlums of the Jacobin party,
execrating the victims and howling with
glee whenever the dread axe fell.</p>
<p>Among the riff-raff, Mere Frochard and
her precious son Jacques Frochard were
conspicuous. For no particular reason
they were gloating over the cutting-off of
aristocrats, whilst indulging in rough
horseplay at the expense of the friends
of the condemned. Picard&rsquo;s quaint look of
helpless sympathy excited ready mirth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sniveling over those good-for-nothings,
eh?&rdquo; La Frochard curled her heavy
moustachioed lip in scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way to make that sensitive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
young man feel something&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she confided
to Jacques. A moment later she had pulled
over a sansculotte&rsquo;s bayonet, with which
she executed a neat jab into Picard&rsquo;s anatomy.</p>
<p>Picard leaped in the air like a jumping
jack. When he descended to earth and
turned to survey the cause of his torment,
he faced but an impassive trooper with
weapon at parade rest and the grinning
countenances of Mere and Jacques Frochard,
convulsed with laughter.</p>
<p>Picard decided the vicinity of the guillotine
was almost as dangerous for him as
for his master. He edged out of range,
biding the occasion for a counter-thrust....</p>
<p>Pierre and Louise stood on the other side
of the scaffold, the heavy structure of
which quite hid the ruffian Frochards and
their horseplay with Picard.</p>
<p>Henriette had been borne up the steps
of the guillotine a few moments before
Pierre and Louise reached the scene. The
cripple, terribly excited, was telling Louise
of Henriette&rsquo;s being strapped to the board
and shoved toward the knife vent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That big murderer is going to kill
her!&rdquo; hissed Pierre.</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s blind features became contorted
with agony. Large tear drops fell
from her eyes. Both arms were extended
toward her sister above, then clawed convulsively
at Pierre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They-have-put-her-head-in-the
crossboard-and&ndash;&ndash;oh, oh!&ndash;&ndash;fastened-it-down!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The-executioner-is-all-ready.&rdquo; Pierre
was gesticulating like a madman. He
seemed to be raising despairing hands to
high Heaven, in token of helplessness.</p>
<p>Above&ndash;&ndash;around&ndash;&ndash;everywhere, he looked
for succor; found none. A glance from
Henriette&rsquo;s doomed form to Louise&rsquo;s bitter
anguish converts him into a maniac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HE&rsquo;S ASKING THE MASTER FOR
THE SIGNAL TO PULL THE ROPE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pierre shouts the words in a fury that
is rapidly growing uncontrollable. Spectators
for the first time notice his strange
actions. But neither the expectant executioner
nor the self-important master of
ceremonial looks down, or distinguishes the
cry in the babel of savage sounds.</p>
<p>The wild youth now disengages himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
from Louise&rsquo;s clutch. With his right hand
he pulls a dagger from his hip pocket.
Look! As the master&rsquo;s signalling hand is
upraised high and begins to lower, the boy
leaps up the steps of the guillotine, and
attacks the executioner whose fingers are
already on the death rope....</p>
<p>Ride on yet more fiercely, O Danton
and ye fierce Cavalrymen&ndash;&ndash;ride on, e&rsquo;en
past the barrier, if Jacques-Forget-Not and
his men do not stay thee. Yes, thank God!
there may yet be time, should this maniac
with the dagger provide sufficient respite!</p>
<p>... The brawny butcher is too astonished
to defend himself. His nerveless
fingers are no longer on the rope; he
stands like a stalled ox in front of his homicidal
assailant. With the rapidity of
lightning Pierre plunges his long Provencal
dirk in the executioner&rsquo;s side. The
butchered butcher falls with a single bawling
outcry and a groan. The crowd is
thunderstruck, and the pinioned de Vaudrey
is wild with joy. Though bound and
helpless, he tries to leap up to his prostrate
Henriette.</p>
<p>But the master of ceremonial, at first too
panic-stricken to intervene, now summons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the sansculotte guards from the ground below.
Up the steps on the double-quick
they rush with fixed bayonets. As the
huge victim falls back into the arms of his
assistant, the bayoneting soldiers corner the
dirk-waving Pierre.</p>
<p>The brief contest is quite unequal. In
less time than it takes to tell it, one of the
men plunges his bright, long steel in
Pierre&rsquo;s side. The latter falls like a lump
of clay on the scaffold flooring. Several
of the bayonets speed toward the inert
lump, with the intent on the part of their
owners to fling the body contemptuously
from the scaffold to the floor.</p>
<p>But a more refined cruelty speaks: &ldquo;Save
him for the guillotine!&rdquo; The soldiers
leave the crumpled-up, desperately wounded
Pierre, dooming him yet to taste La Guillotine&rsquo;s
embrace. They subdue de Vaudrey
and truss him up anew.</p>
<p>The roars of the crowd die down. Comparative
order is again restored. The
master of ceremonial, having recovered
the habit of command, orders Jean, the
remaining executioner, to complete the
stricken one&rsquo;s job.</p>

<p>Fortunately for our heroine under the
knife, the second executioner is slow and
awkward. He has seen butchery come
quite too close to his own flesh! Still
somewhat unnerved, he prepares himself
for the task with clumsy movements and
halting fingers. The master bids him
hurry&ndash;&ndash;Jean takes his time, he&rsquo;s not going
to bungle the job....</p>
<p>As the supreme moment nears, it is well
that we should note what is happening with
Danton and his Centaurs&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>DANTON&rsquo;S RIDERS</h3>
</div>
<p>About half way of the journey through
the City, Jacques-Forget-Not and his men
take up a stand in front of the onrushing
cavalry.</p>
<p>They wave orders and prohibitions.</p>
<p>They yell to the horsemen to draw rein.</p>
<p>Resistlessly the troopers keep their careering
course&ndash;&ndash;the talk and gestures are
but as the East Wind to tensed Danton,
stern-set Captain, and the rest.</p>
<p>Forget-Not&rsquo;s tribe escape the deadly
horse hoofs by quick side jumps.</p>
<p>Within the next few minutes&ndash;&ndash;even
while the head executioner is making the
little victim ready&ndash;&ndash;Danton and his riders
reach the barrier on the Guillotine side of
Paris. Orders had already been received
to close the gates at the cavalry&rsquo;s approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! there is not a moment to lose,&rdquo;
yells the Jacobin commander as he sights
the oncoming host. He hastens to deploy
his soldiers with spears and pikes across
the barrier, whilst the keepers bring the
heavy gates to.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>The barred gates and the opposing
fighters threaten to dash Danton&rsquo;s every
hope of saving by reprieve his &ldquo;dear one
of treasured memory.&rdquo; Indeed, as we
have seen, but for frenzied Pierre&rsquo;s maniacal
slaughter of the headsman, the fatal
blow would now be falling! Neither Danton
nor his men, of course, know that. Theirs
to struggle on, to confront and conquer
fortune, never to despair! Within those
iron souls is no such thought as &ldquo;Defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurrah!</p>
<p>One foremost rider has managed to
squeeze through the mighty gates before
they clang. Danton and the rest of his
men face a small army on the closed barrier&rsquo;s
City side.</p>
<p>The superb horses would charge against
a stone wall if bade to! They charge
against the living wall of foot soldiers;
kicking, pounding, trampling in the narrow
space, while the riders strike.</p>
<p>Some footmen perish under the hoofs.
Others save themselves by leaping, scrambling
out over the side parapets. The attack
becomes a rout. Hip-hip-hurrah! The
lone rider on the guillotine side has succeeded
in unloosing the bar. The gates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
fly open. Danton&rsquo;s cavalry dash madly
down the straight and unobstructed road
that leads to the Place de la Execution,
still a few furlongs distant!</p>
<p>Can they even yet save her? For now it
would appear as if the supremely tragical
moment might anticipate them&ndash;&ndash;by
seconds!</p>
<p>During the final furlongs&ndash;&ndash;the executioner
now in readiness&ndash;&ndash;Henriette looks
up with gaping mouth at the awful knife
edge. A terrible cry escapes her. Wracked
with agony, she gazes about at the sea of
hostile faces&ndash;&ndash;not one stray iota of sympathy
in that Dark Hour. Missing is de
Vaudrey, missing the loved blind sister!
As the down-dropping gesture of Death is
again begun by the grim master of ceremonial,
Henriette with a low cry of
&ldquo;Louise!&rdquo; shuts eyes and drops head to
receive the stroke!</p>
<p>But the clatter of myriad hoofbeats assails
the Master&rsquo;s ears; the hoarse cries of
Danton&rsquo;s riders, and the astonished roars
of the populace. His hand falters. He
turns to look at the tumult. The executioner
takes his hand off the rope.</p>
<p>The cavalrymen are dashing down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
roadway, from which quick clearance has
been made by the sansculotte guards and
the loaferish spectators. At their head
gallops Danton, the Thunderer of old,
thundering at the officials, waving in his
free hand a State paper!</p>
<p>In front of the death machine he halts
and dismounts&ndash;&ndash;then taking the steps in
two bounds, puts the reprieve of Henriette
and Maurice in the hands of the master of
ceremonial!</p>
<p>The Savior of France&ndash;&ndash;the Organizer of
Victory&ndash;&ndash;brings such a show of power at
his back and compels such respect that
none dare question him. He strides to the
guillotine, bades the trembling executioner
release Henriette&ndash;&ndash;himself personally unstraps
her from the death board. So ensues
a scene that would wring even a heart
of stone: the delivery of a demented girl
from Death&rsquo;s very passion and utmost
pang!</p>
<p>Danton takes the little form in his arms,
looks in her eyes, kisses her and tries to
make her understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the honor of France,&rdquo; he cries to
the assembled multitude, as he still upholds
her swaying figure, &ldquo;a monstrous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
injustice is righted. This girl, and that young
patriot,&rdquo; signifying to the attendants that
de Vaudrey should be unloosed, &ldquo;are reprieved
by the order of the Revolutionary
Tribunal!&rdquo; The multitude&ndash;&ndash;caught by
Danton&rsquo;s tensely dramatic announcement&ndash;&ndash;applauds,
even as it had jeered and mocked
a few moments since.</p>
<p>But the girl, kept from falling by his protective
left arm, still gazes upon him idiotically.
She had died, was it not true ? How
then, she lives? What are these crowds,
and who is this stranger? The gallant
rescuer fears that her reason is gone!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release that boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has seen the wounded Pierre trussed
in the far corner of the scaffold, guessed
that some wild deed of the lad&rsquo;s stayed the
judicial murder. His tones to the officials
are sharp, imperative. The outraged superior
of the hacked executioner looks
around the assemblage for some prop of
resistance&ndash;&ndash;finds none&ndash;&ndash;trembles&ndash;&ndash;and is
all bows and scrapes to do Danton&rsquo;s will.
Pierre crawls painfully across the platform.
He kisses the hem of his Savior&rsquo;s garment.</p>
<p>Danton has brought Henriette to the
ground. He is looking for her friends now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Catching sight of blind Louise starting up
the steps, he brings her around and puts the
loved sisters in front of one another....
Slowly the light of understanding comes
into the eyes of her who had most loved
and most suffered. She embraces Louise....
Danton is looking for yet another
figure, the affianced of Henriette. He
draws over de Vaudrey, places the latter&rsquo;s
right hand within the free hand of
Henriette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; he says kindly to de Vaudrey.
&ldquo;It is enough for me that I have saved
France from this foul blot!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>... Down in the crowd, too, the fortunes
of war have changed. The wicked
Frochards, who have been egging on the
crowds to jeer the victims, have become
distinctly unpopular. It is Picard&rsquo;s turn to
jest the Frochards now.</p>
<p>A grenadier offers a little friendly assistance
with the bayonet, pricking the old
hag in a tender part as if by accident.
She jumps and squeals. Sly Picard watches
another chance, shoves forward his friend&rsquo;s
bayonet to prick her again.</p>
<p>... Both she and her precious Jacques
the Good-for-Nothing take it on the run,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
enduring the buffets of the railing soldiery.
Yes, Picard&ndash;&ndash;our genial rogue of a body
servant&ndash;&ndash;gets in the last bayonet pricks and
body wallops of this story!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE AFTERMATH</h3>
</div>
<p>Danton later suffered the dark hour and
the snapping of Life&rsquo;s thread through
Robespierre&rsquo;s cruelty, but the glory of that
valiant soul is eternal.</p>
<p>His plea for the ways of Mercy&ndash;&ndash;his gallant
deeds (like this particular one) of risking
all for the life of a friend&ndash;&ndash;were as
signposts to bewildered humanity. He
foresaw the precipice down which the Terrorists
were headed for the pit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time twelvemonth I was moving
the creation of that same Revolutionary
Tribunal. I crave pardon for it of God and
man. They are all Brothers Cain&ndash;&ndash;I leave
the whole business in a frightful welter.
Robespierre will follow me; I drag down
Robespierre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a verity, the following Thermidor or
hot July saw the fate come true. Universally
execrated, the Tyrant was himself
dragged down and guillotined. Fell with
him the rest of the murdering crew. Black
hatred&ndash;&ndash;foul suspicion&ndash;&ndash;wicked vengeance
vanished like departing plagues.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>There dawned happier days wherein justice
bore sway, and little gardens of flowers
and love and happiness again sprang up
and flourished. Among these blooming
gardens let us seek the refuge of Count and
Countess de Linieres after the Storm has
abated and the kinsfolk it has sundered are
united. The sisters of our story are their
especial care, daughter and foster-daughter
of the exquisite chatelaine.</p>
<p>Young Maurice de Vaudrey is their pride.
The old gentleman has reconciled himself
to the passing of the Ancient Regime, and
through his nephew&rsquo;s good office has made
his peace with the State.</p>
<p>On a bright and beautiful day as Henriette
is flitting about the garden, the
Doctor&ndash;&ndash;none other than our old friend of
La Force&ndash;&ndash;comes with a precious gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The removal of the cataract has been
successful,&rdquo; he says, presenting Louise. &ldquo;Is
it not a joy that she can see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls intertwine arms and laugh happily.
The parents approach. Henriette
and Louise embrace the Count, now their
foster parent and protector. Back of the
Count limps the devoted Pierre, now fully
restored from his old hurt of the bayonet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
thrust. Pierre is to be the Countess&rsquo;s
especial care.</p>
<p>That lovely lady has received her daughter
Louise within her arms, a daughter who
for the first time can look upon the mother
of whose loving care she was deprived for
a score of years. In a few moments Henriette
summons her sister to her side as a
young man, whom we should all recognize,
joins the little company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to present to your new eyes
Monsieur Maurice de Vaudrey&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; then
with a shy smile and a glance back and
forth, Henriette adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do you approve of him?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recurs the memory of that almost forgotten
incident in the Normandy home&ndash;&ndash;Henriette&rsquo;s
promise to stay single till the
blind sister should win sight and approve
the suitor. Louise is so happy that she decides
to tease. She is about to shake her
small head and her lips to frame &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;
But in another moment she uses her new
gift to inspect the marvelous young man of
whose perfections she had so often heard.</p>
<p>She looks at Maurice from top to toe;
the shapely head covered with luxuriant
locks, the fine brown eyes, the Apollo features
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
comely yet sensitive, the elegant form,
small hands and feet, the graceful and
chivalrous carriage&ndash;&ndash;the MAN who is
looking at her with a kindly affectionate
smile. Really, Henriette hadn&rsquo;t told her
half enough! She clasps her sister with
one hand, Maurice with the other, cries:
&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may leave our hero and heroine
there&ndash;&ndash;as Louise and the oldsters presently
left them&ndash;&ndash;to taste the exquisite happiness
of mutual love. For Love is stronger than
Death, and must prevail. And the kisses
of Maurice and Henriette blotted out all
the wrack and nightmare of the &ldquo;Orphans
of the Storm!&rdquo;</p>
